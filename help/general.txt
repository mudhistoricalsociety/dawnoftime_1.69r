text The DawnFTP client allows you to edit outside of the mud's default 
description editor, and on your personal computer.  Once set up, you can 
edit anything from your description to notes to anything done on OLC, in the 
Notepad program by default, or you can set up to edit your favorite word 
program.`+
`+
To set up DawnFTP, You must download first the dawnftp client... you can 
download a windows version of the client for free from 
`#`B`_http://www.dawnoftime.org/dawnftp`x`^`+
`+
Instructions how to setup dawnftp are at the website address quoted above.`+
`+
Some notes on DAWNFTP:`+
Use ``+ for a new line instead of ``1... as ``+ allows easier remote editing.`+
`+
As always, if you are having problems getting the DawnFTP to work properly, 
contact the support council for help.`+
`+
Please note that you may have problems logging in if you have capital 
letters in your password.`+
`+
DawnFtp is based on Mudftp v2 written by Oliver Jowett <icecube@ihug.co.nz>.`+
`+
The Dawn of Time codebase also supports MUDFTP connections.  If mudftp 
support is enabled you can find out the port supporting mudftp connections 
with the gamesettings command.`+

text As a hero you are entitled to have a limited version of the restring command.
This is a very great privilage, and should not be taken lightly.
 
Along with privilage comes responsibility, as a hero your responsibiliies in 
reguards to restringing are.  
 
 
1.  You will only do restrings for yourself, in NO circumstances can you 
restring for someone else.  The one exception to this is if you restring an 
item which is of type trash or clothing, something that has NO value
abilities. 
It must be basically useless.  And this is then used for some type of
roleplay ie, restringing a trash item like a vulpine pelt into a Leather vest. 
In this  case you may give a restring away, but you MUST send a note to
immortal saying you have done it.
 
2.  You will not restring any item into anything that is ooc in any way, and 
you will make sure that anything you restring is of a high quality. Objects
should not have names in their shorts. ie. The Immense sword of
Annihilation, or the Shield of Takhisis. Each object should ideally only
describe its physical appearance in both its short and long. Name keywords
too should be appropriate for that object.
Those objects in the game that do have names, etc, in their descriptions,
are a)either immortal-created items, or b)items approved by the immortals. 
 
3.  NO restringing of artifacts, or other important items. ie. Restringing an
enemies sword, or a roleplay item.
 
4.  Finally if restring is abused in any way we have forseen or have not
forseen it will be immediately removed without the possibility for you to
get it back.
 
5.  If you want to use colours, make sure you understand how the colour code 
works (`#`Chelp `=_colour`^).
 
6. Restrings must be within our setting. So, no 'Saberlights'.
 
7. Do not use names/descriptions from other fantasy worlds, such as 'Sword of 
Takhisis'.

As a basic estimate 100 gold coins are four times as heavy as silver coins
(25 to the pound, as opposed to 100 to the pound for silver).  Weight is 
the measure of the total weight you can carry.

Encumberance is different from weight, for example you may easily be able 
to carry a pack full of lead if it say weighs 80 kilos.  The total weight
is all contained in the pack it isn't bulky and doesn't encumber you.  On 
the other hand you may struggle more trying to carry 20 lightweight but 30
foot long poles.  Even though the poles weigh less than the lead, they are 
harder to carry as they get in the way when moving etc.  Encumberance is a
measure of how restricting an item is.

To this end deaths from `rmobs`=? are not permanent.  Deaths from players will be 
permanent.  To be killed permanently though a character must be killed until 
their soul is purged of karns before their spirit is forced to depart 
forever.  Each mortal is gifted by the gods of all, 3 rebirths or (Karn's). `+
`+
As spend more time in the realm, your chances of regaining karns increases 
as well.  The maximum number of karns one may collect, is dependant on the 
`mpkratio`=? (see `Chelp pkratio`=?).  Those that live by the sword are less inclined 
to regain karns.  When you die, insuring you have at least one karn left, 
you will be transported to the location where all are placed when given 
another chance, and be naked and ready to begin anew.  Left behind in the 
room where you were killed, is all your clothing together with all of your 
equipment.`+

one remaining.`+

Of these timers, the hp/mana/move regeneration timer is popularly called the
'tick'.  Ticks on this mud average 45 seconds of real time, but the actual 
amount varies randomly from 30 seconds to 60 seconds.

Area resetting happens roughly every 3 minutes if no one is in the area; less 
often (15 minutes) if some one is.  Also note that objects lying on the 
ground will not be regenerated if anyone is in the area when it resets.

text 'Immortal' (often, simply, 'imm') refers to players who have reached
the highest attainable levels in the game.  Here, anyone of level 92
or higher is an 'immortal'.  Immortals are capable of exceeding the
usual game rules, in more drastic and pervasive ways as levels increase;
examples range from teleportation and invisibility to mortal sight to
creation of objects, removal of a player's privileges (channels,
ability to move, or even ability to log in), and ability to promote
players to immortality.`+
`+
Since immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are (ideally)
a carefully-chosen and policed group.  An absolute rule of immortal
behaviour is that no immortal can aid or assist any player without
explicit permission from the higher ranks; in other words, please
don't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ, etc, or
you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred to
this file.`+

`c    *********************************************************
`c    ** `G26 Rules for Immortals to make a happy Mud for all`c **
`c    *********************************************************`=?
 
1.  You may play mortal characters, but they should get no special 
    treatment with the exception of being able to use immtalk.
 
2.  Do not do 'RP activities' unless you have been cleared to do so
    by the admin.  RP activities includes going IC with your 
    immortal character and controlling mobs in any way what so ever 
    (this includes forcing mobs to do things).
 
3.  Do not reveal the identity of any mortal to any mortals.
    This especially includes revealing to the playerbase that your
    mortal is played by someone who is an imm, or another imms 
    mortal is played by an imm.
 
4.  Do not do corpse recoveries for any immortal players mortal 
    regardless of its level.  You may rarely do a corpse recovery 
    for players under level 10 if there arent very many players on.
    A better way to handle this is ask a higher level mort to do the 
    recovery 'ICly'.
 
5.  You may not multilog with ANY of your mortal characters... The
    ONLY acception to this is if you are logging on a
    `R*`=?test character to test mobprogs etc.
    This only applies to a few of the imms as 
    most mobprog building/testing is done on the olc port... and when
    testing is done on this port, that is with a test char not a 
    mortal character that actually belongs to you.  If you are in 
    doubt about this, please talk to an admin before logging on 
    multiple characters.
 
6.  You may not increase any perm stats on mortals if you have the 
    power to do so... perm stats means things like maxhp, maxmana,
    maxmove, maxstrength, max<anyattribute>... you may set stats 
    like tiredness, hunger, thirst, alliance and tendency if done
    according to the established systems for doing so.
 
7.  With your mortal characters you may not start a pkill fight 
    with another mortal without first obtaining permission from an
    admin.  This is due to the fact you know more about that mortal
    than they know about themselves and can create huge conflicts 
    of interest.
 
8.  For your immortal characters turn on autosubdue and try to leave 
    it on at all times unless you must pkill a mort due to the IC 
    circumstances.
 
9.  Do not abuse your immortal powers to pick on a mortal, if you have
    a problem with an mortal, discuss it with another imm to work it 
    thru instead of making the situation worse.
 
10. Do not cheat for ANY mortal in ANY way, especially your own!
 
11. Do not transfer mortals around for them to save them having to 
    travel there themselves, 
 
12. Dont get equipment for other mortals.
 
13. Dont kill shopkeepers
 
14. Dont attempt to compenstate mortals for accidental deaths caused 
    by an imm (i.e. moot them back the xp and set their karns back up
    by one.)  You can get their corpse and stuff, then write a note 
    to admin and the admin will fix them up.  This includes the 
    compensation for OOC pkills.  There are many reasons for this policy
    the main one being that if the admin deal with it, then it will be 
    dealt with in a consistant way.  But other reasons include other 
    more minor points like mooting their xp back increases their RPS 
    as well as XP.    
 
14b Dont run with scissors.
 
15. All quest rewards if a new or modified object must be approved by 
    the balance council prior to giving the item to the reciepant.  
    The procedure for doing this is creating the quest reward, writing 
    an inote to balance, then balance writing an inote back stating 
    the response (these inotes could also be cc'ed to rp).  Using this 
    system means everyone is aware of what is happening and we dont 
    get mystery objects appearing in the game.
    note: the only exception to this rule is if the only modifications 
    to an existing object is in the form of it being restrung or the 
    new item is of type trash.
 
16. Remember at all times we are a team, be considerate of each other.
    If you have a problem with how another imm is behaving, speak with 
    them about it (if you feel confident enough to do so),  Otherwise
    speak with the person in charge of the council they mainly work in.
    If that isn't an option speak with someone in admin.
 
16b Never take Imidazole seriously.
    
17. The OOC use of the slay command to kill should be only to resolve
    something in bug testing, and not as any form of punishment. If a 
    player is misbehaving, the better option than a slay is that you 
    nochannel them then transfer them to room 299.  Leave them there for 
    a while or talk to them - up to you.  If you dont think you can be 
    professional with how you handle them or dont want to handle them
    just tell them they will have to speak with an admin... if they keep
    spamming you with tells, just notell them.
    The IC use of the slay command should follow the directions in 'help 
    ooc-commands-icly'.
 
18. If you nochannel a player, You are responsible to remove the nochannel 
    before you logout or write or get another imm to write a penatly 
    explaining the situation.  If a player asks for their channels back and
    there is not a penatly relating to it you may remove the nochannel if 
    none of the imms online at the time knows about it.
 
19. Dont leave mortals in your own personal norecall rooms then logout on 
    them, if another imm logs on they can put the player back into ooc.  
    (unless of course you want them left in your room, then write an 
    inote about it to let everyone know what is happening.
 
20. Dont take over other peoples areas they are working on... this includes
    taking over peoples quests (unless listquest shows you are allowed to).
    Also includes areas like attempting to get too involved in a council 
    you havent been invited to be involved with.
 
20b You shall pay homage to Kerenos at all times.
 
21. If a note you are going to write is not going to be sent to any mortal,
    then dont write it in the general notes spool - write either an inote or
    penatly.
 
22. If you have a mortal in mind to propose as a new imm, please talk to
    or send an inote to admin first.
 
23. Work together as team, this includes things like communicating with inotes
    and updating the status of quests with qedit.
 
24. Dont sit whoinvis all day!  If you are online, and dont have to be invisible
    on the wholist, go whovis.
 
25. Do your best to help out with short descriptions, and letgaining.
 
26. Have fun!!! I realise this is a long list of do nots, and we arent trying
    to be depressing, but as the mud gets bigger, it is necessary to have a 
    documented standard for what is expected from everyone, that way things
    run smoothly.
 
26b Ah, yes, and don't forget to brush your teeth.
 
 
Notes :-
A Test Character is as stated previously to be used only for testing problems
or areas you are working on .. All test Characters "MUST" have a name that 
contains the word test (for exaple balotest or testthor) and should be added
to the clan immortal ..
 
If for Historical/RP reasons you as an Immortal wish to have an Old character
you must first clear this with the Implementor and if acceptable you will be
allowed to create a mobile .. you can then switch into this mob to perform any
RP actions you wish.

it for experience.  Healing and casting protective spells on them is fine 
but do not hurt a mob to near death for someone else to gain the experience 
points. Weakening a mob with spells is not allowed as well.
`+
`s11. `=? Do not STEAL or PKILL a Link Dead player or `g[AFK]`=? player.  If you see

`cMultilogging/Equipment Exchange:`=?`+
`s17. `=? Do not Multilog at all at any time.  This means having TWO or more 
characters on at the SAME TIME.  You may create more than one character, but

classed as "multilogging".  Penalties can include deletion and/or a site 
ban.  `+
`+
`s21. `=? Exchanging equipment and/or money between your characters is forbidden. 
This includes (but not necessarily limited to) dropping equipment/money with 
one char, logging off then picking it up with another char of yours... or 
giving an object to another player to give to your low level character (this 
is called equipment exchange).  All players involved in these actions will 
suffer the consquences, these include deletion of all characters involved 
and possibly banning depending on the situation.`+

`cPkilling behaviour:`=?`+
`s22. `=? Do not bring in your high-level character to pkill someone who was 
involved with your low-level character.  If you have more than one 
character, they never met IC, and do not know each other.  Your characters 
being brothers is not an excuse.  If you do it your high level character 
will be deleted.  `+
`+
`s23. `=? ALL pkills `RMUST`=? have a decent amount of RP preceeding the pkill event.`+
`+
`s24. `=? ALL pkills must have an In charcter basis (`Yhelp pk-reasons`=?).  `+
`+
 * "He stole from me and I instantly slayed him" is NOT a valid pkill 
reason.  `+
 * "I am -3 -3 alignment and I'm evil" is not valid reason.  `+
 * "I hate all elves" is not a valid reason.  `+

this period.  This also includes pk agressive actions such as spitting, 
stealing and/or trying to get someone to pkill you.  `+
`+

purpose of permanently killing a character results in harsh penalties.  `+
`+
`s27. `=? Do not purposely go Link Dead `Y[LD]`=? in a pkill fight.  `+
`+
 `c----------------------------------`+
`cClan Halls:`=?`+
`s28.  `=? Do not log out in someone else's clan hall unless you are on 100% 
peaceful terms with that clan!!!  `+
`+
`c----------------------------------`+
`cThe General Rules:`=?`+
`s29. `=? Respect Immortals they are there to help you.  If you receive an answer

protected by the LINKDEAD rule.  How do you know if a player has a timer you 
say?  In most cases you wont know so the best idea is DONT attack or steal 
from the player, if you are wrong then you will suffer the penalties.  Using 
this as an excuse ie "I thought he had a timer" will result in even more 
harsh penalties than for the standard offense.  `1`1 Any player attempting to use the LINKDEAD rule as a means of escape from

  IC time is exactly 10 times faster than IRL time but due to there 
  being 3 weeks per month 10months IRL doesnt equal 1month IC.  
  The direct 1 to 10 relationship therefore ends at the week.
 
     One IC minute = 6 seconds IRL
     One IC hour   = 6 minutes IRL
     One IC day    = 2 hours and 24 minutes IRL
     One IC week   = 16 hours, 48 minutes IRL
     Ten IC weeks  = 1 week IRL
     One IC month  = 2 days, 2 hours, 24 minutes IRL

keyword SUBLEVELS SUBPRACS SUBTRAINS SUBPRACTICES SUB-LEVELS~
category undefined~
text The Sublevel system if enabled on comes into affect at level 50.`+
`+
The sublevel system was introduced so we could make xp above level 50 easier 
for killing things, depending on what level but xp can be 10times higher, 
some times even more if you level 80 or more.  Reaching hero is now harder 
for sure, but on the bright side there is a chance for new players coming to 
have a chance of not getting killed of because the cost of dying is so much 
higher a higher level player is going to be less likely to risk killing you 
off and at the same time it takes a lot more work to get a huge level 
advantage in combat.  `+
`+
Each level 50 and above requires you to first complete 1 or more sublevels.  
The sublevels required for that level are shown in your score which becomes 
visible once reaching 50.  If you had say 2 sublevels for a level (as is the 
case for a level 54 player), you would first have to gain the equivalent 
amount of xp to gain a level 3 times before reaching level 54.  The first 
level worth of XP will raise your sublevel from 0/2 to 1/2.  The second to 
2/2, and then the next level worth will gain your actual level.  `+
`+
A system of subtrains and subpracs has also been added, how this works is 
each sublevel you gain a subprac or subtrain, when your subpracs reaches 2 
you get an additional practice to use and your subprac is set to 0, 
subtrains work the same but requiring 5 subtrains per train.  `+
`+
Once you start gaining sublevels you will lose 500xp + (250* the number of 
sublevels for your level)`+
Some number examples:`+
-- LEVEL --- Sublevel per level --- calculation ------------- xp lost ---`+
    51        1                   500+ (250*1) = 500+ 250  =  750xp lost`+
    58        3                   500+ (250*3) = 500+ 750  = 1250xp lost`+
    73        6                   500+ (250*6) = 500+1500  = 2000xp lost`+
`+
You don't lose subpracs and subtrains for dying as the loss is considered 
enough without more losses.  If you flee and lose a sublevel you will also`+
lose the subtrains and subpracs you just got.  If you lose a level, then you 
have most of the sublevels required to relevel.`+
`+
The number of sublevels are required per level depends on the level, here is 
a basic guide of the requirements at this stage, these may be changed:`+
`+
Sublevels for level in range`+
1 50-54`+
2 55-57`+
3 58-60`+
4 61-65`+
5 66-70`+
6 71-75`+
7 76-80`+
8 81-85`+
9 86-89`+
10 90-91`+
`+ 
note: You can use the gameset command to see if sublevels are enabled.`+
