text ..             Questing on Dawn of time - Immortal helpfile
 
Quests on DoT are divided on 3 categories:
 
`yMAJOR QUESTS:`=? These are quests that involve all, or most of the realm. Army
invasions, falling gods, the return of Kron, etc... To keep the consistency and
focus of the game, there should be only one major quest running at a time.
 
`yMINOR QUESTS:`=? These are quests that involve few players, and not-too-much
catastrophic events. A ghost haunting a house, an old enemy seeking personal
vengeance, the kidnapping of a character's son, etc. There can be as many minor
quests running at a time as possible, and, in fact, it is those, and not the
major ones, that mostly add to the game's flavour.
 
`yOOC QUESTS:`=? These are contests of all sorts, published through ooc channels
(note to all, ooc, etc.) OOC quests may give IC prizes or not, but are also
important as a means to get players involved in the game and encourage their
participation. There can be as many ooc quests running at once as possible, but
let's not overdose them.

text ..          DOs and DON'Ts to bear in mind while running quests:
 
`y- Keep quests believable.`=? Although this is a fantasy environment, there is a
limit between fantasy and toons. If at every major quest there is a new fallen
god, a new threat to the world, a new 'Deus-ex-machina', soon, ALL of our quests
will lose their flavour. Keep quests simple and involving. There can be fun
without threatening the world.
 
`y- Involve the players.`=? Players want to get involved. Getting something to
haunt them from their past, or a secret they never thaught they had always
entices them. Player histories are rich in details that can be used for hooks
into quests, and they sure love it.
 
`y- Be impartial.`=? Try to involve also the not-so-good rpers into quests, give
everyone an equal chance. Anyone can run a nice quest with only good rpers, but
truly good quests can take the best out of most players, even those who don't
usually involve themselves in questing. Most players are only waiting for a
chance.
 
`y- Do not rush.`=? Even if you desperately want to make a certain quest happen,
talk it over with the rp council first, it just may not be the time for it right
now, it may get into another ongoing quest, or it may just not fit into the
scheme, or don't, but we have to know what's going on if we are to create a
believable, coherent environment for the players. (and everyone likes coherence
and believability).

text 1. Using words like 'mob' 'NPC' 'level' in general conversation.  The 
rationale behind this is that if you are actually are an 'Orc Warrior'
your life would not be based on levels, and your enemies would be real,
not mobs.
 
Bad roleplay  "where can I go to kill some mobs and level?" 
 
A better way: "I am a young adventurer, and in need of excitement.  I 
               Have heard stories of a swamp invested with evil, where
               can I go to dispatch this evil horde."
 
               A lot will depend on your characters, personality.
 
 
2. Using a characters name before you have met them.  An 'Orc Warrior'
or any other person, would not know anyone's name before meeting them.
 
Bad Roleplay: "hi, Boris I've seen you online."
 
A better way: "Greetings sir, I am called Ilora what name are you 
              known by."
 
 
3. Using the who list or the laston command to find out a players name.
And using that name in conversation is not good roleplay.
 
Bad Roleplay: "Yeah i saw Kith was on yesterday."
 
A better way: "Has anyone seen a tall human, that smokes a lot?"
 
 
4. Asking or giving information on the ooc channel which is IC.
 
Bad Roleplay: 1. ooc: "Damn ShenYang just killed me!"
              2. ooc: "Does anyone know where i can get a good sword?"
              3. ooc: "Ok, I'm going to attack it now, you come in 
                      afterwards."
 
A better way: 1. ooc:  There is no better way.  But you can use any
                       method of communication which is considered IC
                       eg, say, yell, whisper
              2. say:  "Do you have an idea, to where I might find a
                       more suitable sword?"
              3. yell: "Enter once I have given the word!"
 
 
5.  Doing a say or whisper prefixed by ooc:
   
    eg.  'say "OOC: Hi, I'm a from Melbourne."'  
    OR   'say "OOC: sorry, typo."'
 
 
6.  Putting :), :P :|, etc in a say or whisper.
 
 
7   Using emote to blatantly communicate with another character, 
    that does not speak your language.
 
    eg 'emote say "I am Krystin, can you help me."'
    OR 'emote does not understand.'
    OR 'emote wonders if you would like to go to the reeking village.'
 
8.  Getting protection before going hunting/to battle
 
Bad roleplay:     Asking someone to "spell you up" or "sanc" you.
 
A better way:     "I'm about to hunt down some very nasty creatures, I 
                   need all the protection I can get.. can you help me?" 
          or:     "I am going on a new adventure, do you think you could

text 1. Good roleplay is essentially making decisions and doing actions
   in line with what your character would do, if your character was
   actually in that situation.

   These decisions will be based upon your character's alignment,
   the history you submit, online history, and any other goals 
   you have previously set out for your character.

   Therefore you must control your character in such a manner consistent
   with the above criteria, irrespective of what YOU personally would do
   in that situation.  (Always remember your character is not you.)

   For Example:  A good lawful character, will probably  stand up for
   weaker players even thou that character is likely to die.

   And a chaotic evil player, will probably attack indiscriminately 
   without respect for age, race, class, gender, and strength of
   opponent.

2. Other Examples

   1.  A good aligned player may refuse to use a vampiric weapon
       because that weapon takes away life.  Even thou that weapon
       may provide an advantage in combat.

   2.  A good aligned player may also refuse to use a cursed, or
       once cursed weapon.  For much the same reasons as 1.

   3.  A lawful aligned player may wish to avoid conflict which is 
       unlawful. eg, stealing, murder, revenge.  A lawful player will 
       look for solutions with in the law.

   4.  A chaotic aligned player will break the law as a means to an
       ends.  A good chaotic aligned character may murder to avenge
       a death.

   5.  An evil aligned player does things which may or may not affect
       others, but there only consideration is for their cause.  An evil
       lawful may bury the dead of their enemies, treat prisoners well,
       and in all respects act honourably within the law, but their 
       overall cause may well harm others.

   6.  A neutral aligned character will tend to be indifferent towards 
       the belief's of another character, but will be influenced by that
	 other character's action.   Evil and good aligned characters, 
       may tend to blinded by their own causes and thus cannot sometimes
       see past another's belief's. 

       Neutral character's have a unique perceptive as they see both
       sides of the coin.
   
   7.  A neutral aligned player might help a good person recover stolen 
       possessions one day, and the next day may steal those possessions
       away. This is very much dependant on a neutral aligned player's 
       tendency (eg lawful or chaotic), which is a very integral part
       of a neutral aligned players personality.

`Y*`=? Do not tell the reader to perform, feel or action something merely from 
looking at you.  Eg.  "You cringe in horror before this draconian."  It is 
up to the player to decide how they react.  `+
`Y*`=? Follow the race guidlines.  Read help race-<your race> and read the

A short description is what people will see when they walk in the room.  
It is how you will appear to everyone else.  To this end it is very 
important, it is preferred that you have a long description before you 
get a short description, but sometimes an imm might offer to set your

you have written or atleast attempted to write a long description 
(see help long for more on long descriptions).`+
`+
`GSHORT DESCRIPTION RULES:`=?`+
* Your short must have your race in it.`+
* Must show your gender.`+
* No eye colour is allowed (simply because eyes are closed when sleeping).`+
(avoids messages like 'a tall elven woman with green eyes is asleep here.')`+
* A short description `#`Rcannot`^ include information about your behaviour 
or how you react to a particular player.`+
* No `#`Gclothing`^ in a short description since that is seen in your equipment
 list when someone looks at you and also when you die, would cause 
your short to be incorrect.`+
`+
`WConventions used in short descriptions:`=?`+
* If the words woman or man is used in a short but no race is specified, then 
  the race of the player with the short is human.
* If adjectives like beautiful or ugly are used to describe a particular player
that is in comparision to the race of that character.`+
e.g. "a beautiful alaghi female", is beautiful by alaghi standards even though 
all alaghi may appear ugly to a human for example.`+

Examples of bad short descriptions:`+
"An elf with green eyes"`+

`+
"An intelligent elven lady is here."`+
- not everyone can tell someones intelligence by looking at them.`+

text `=?
Alignment is used to represent the values and beliefs that are inside
each Player Character (PC) to help explain why they act the way they do.

This applies to ALL actions performed by EVERY PC - including the
slaying of mobs, talking in the pit, helping other PCs with
advice/equipment, or assisting in Corpse Retrievals (CRs).

The following definitions should be consulted for you to pick the
proper label for the way you plan to act on Dawn of Time.  Once an
alignment is selected, actions performed outside that alignment
are punishable by alignment changes, loss of experience, and worse -
so choose wisely!  

Role-Playing (RP) means you must learn to keep separate your personal
alignment from that of your character, unless of course you have
chosen to RP a character with the same alignment as yourself.

A high level summary:  Law/Neutral/Chaos is the means and
Good/Neutral/Evil is the result or your actions.

`GLaw vs Chaos
`c------------
The standard Cop versus Criminal philosophical differences.

Law - The belief that in order for happiness and safety to exist, a
set of external laws must be followed and obeyed, regardless of the
consequences.  A lawful character believes that all laws must be
obeyed for society to prosper, including those laws that he does
not agree with.  A lawful person does not tolerate those that break
the law.

Chaos - The belief that laws and strictures restrict the happiness of
an individual, and society will be better off without these
restrictions.  In order for a person to achieve the most in life,
they must not be held back by restrictions imposed by others, and
they should be allowed to do whatever they feel like doing.

Neutral (Law/Chaos) - This is either not being able to understand the
concept of a society's laws [wild animals]; or having a personal set
of laws to live by that are close to that of society, but not identical.
This can be simplified to "Laws are important, but I don't mind breaking
little laws, or breaking laws in small ways".  They are always true
to their own personal set of laws.


`GGood vs Evil
`c------------
Good and Evil are opposites and seek to destroy each other.

Good -  The belief that by being fair, just, and nice to others, one
should receive the same treatment in return.  A good person places
the needs of others before their own needs, and as long as everyone
acts this way, the world will be a better place.  A good person does
NOT tolerate the actions of evil people, because it places the good
person at great risk to have someone around that is selfish and does
not place the needs of others before their own.  Good always seeks to
destroy evil, and never harms other good people.

Evil - Evil people lust for pain and suffering, and feel they must dish
it out, before they get it.  Do unto others BEFORE they do unto you.
The evil person actually enjoys being cruel to others, so has no second
thoughts of performing evil acts for the entertainment value alone.  The
evil person does things solely for their own benefit, always placing
their needs above the needs of others.  Evil people have no difficulty
destroying other evil people, as well as good people, if it benefits them.

Neutral (Good/Evil) - The neutral philosophy advocates that both of
the opposing philosophies of good and evil are too extreme.  A neutral
person is open to all ideas, and either strives to keep a balance between
good and evil, by always siding with the weaker, or treating both sides
equally, thus not endorsing one over the other.

text Several automated quests are in the process of being added to the game.  
Automated quests are puzzles of sorts, often with nice rewards at the end.  
The rewards can vary, including things like experience points, special 
magical items, gold, and other fun stuff.  Some of these quests will be all 
problem solving and puzzles, while others may involve combat.  Often quests 
can be solved through a combination of both.  There will even be some in 
which they can be completed in different ways.  Some quests are confined to 
one area, while others may have you travelling all over the realm.
 
There is one main rule for automated quests.  NO OOC HELP!  This means that 
your character must figure out the quest on their own.  You may only get help 
in an IC way. Don't ask questions like 'I seek the way to get to the end of 
the dungeon east of town' or anything that involves a full rundown of how to 
complete the quest.  
 
You may ask questions IC that will help you - For example, part of the 
Ronar's Tomb quest requires you to gather certain items and give them to a 
mob.  You will likely need to do some roleplaying and exploring to find these 
items unless you already know the mud areas very well, and it would be 
alright to ask 'Might you know where i can find a rosebush? For I am hired by 
one who is looking to use its petals as a spell component.'
This is not meant to make the quest harder, but rather to encourage 
roleplaying and ensure that the sometimes powerful rewards are not obtained 
by someone who has cheated.
 
Some brief information about each quest follows:

A character that is letgained is able to PKILL and will receive extra

Why is there this obvious disadvantage to non-letgained characters, well...  
We would like to see everybody submit histories and be letgained, but we 
realise some people may find this tiresome, submitting histories before your

you must submit a history.  We give you the option to submit your history 
when you are ready.  `+

- If there isn't an immortal online to letgain you, and you would like to be

text `GHistory for Raeskan.`=?
 
 Raeskan, is originally from a farming community, some distance northeast 
 of  Mekali.  His first 14 years of life were spent tilling the land and
 helping with farm medial chores.  His parents were not a god faring couple,
 quite the opposite actually, they believed that no god or gods existed and 
 that a man made his own path in the world.  

 Raeskan for the most part agreed with them and has taken this into to his 
 heart.  Unlike his parents Raeskan does not believe in the ways of law.  
 Sure he abides by them in public, but he has a disregard for laws and other 
 people.  He cares only for himself and how he can benefit himself.  At age 
 15 Raeskan was an accomplished liar and part time thief.  Stealing pies and 
 apples from local stores he did so not from hunger but because it was 
 exciting, the thrill was what he craved.  

 A little known fact Raeskan was also the community peeping tom.  It was 
 clear to those that knew him best that Raeskan was struggling, his father 
 figure was lacking in strength.  His words often drove Raeskan to worse 
 deeds.  At the end of his 16 year Raeskan had a disagreement with a fellow 
 worker at a nearby farm where Raeskan had found a job.  The disagreement was 
 violent and a fist fight insured, Raeskan was outmatched and beaten hard by
 the much stronger boy 'gladamere', although not physical hurt bad his pride
 had taken a pounding.  

 Life went on for Raeskan and the incident was long forgotten.  In his early 
 17 year Raeskan was caught stealing money from the baker, he was ordered to 
 publicly apologise and to pay the baker back.  The apology was to be made to 
 the whole community in the town square at noon.  Raeskan had agreed that he 
 would do this and he was expected...  noon came around and the towns people 
 had gathered, they waited..  Suddenly a figure appears running, it is the
 bakers son 'muchor' ..His words are garbled and it takes time to calm him  
 down to understand.  Muchor speaks : 'its gladamere, hes dead face up in a 
 ditch just out of town.. All his clothes are missing and there is much blood 
 running form a stab wound in his back.'  the crowd gasps together and the 
 rumours spread like wildfire.  

 Some 10 leagues south Raeskan strides confidently on, his past behind him a 
 new life ahead.  2 people share Raeskan's mind, his quite and likeable 
 daylight form, of the young naive youth.  And his alter ego of the merciless 
 thief and killer.  
 The only unanswered question is who will have Raeskan's heart.

keyword HISTORY-INFO~
level 1
category undefined~
see_also HISTORY HISTORY-EXAMPLE~
text The History is the most important aspect of your character. It is more 
important than attributes, more important than skills and spells, 
more important than any equipment. You ask why? The reason is pretty 
simple: it is the history that gives your character a meaning, a life of 
its own. 
 
Let us elaborate on that. Role-play means pretending you are someone 
else, in a fantasy, a different, world. Someone that can be totally 
different from you. Tons of fun come from that. Now, we can only play as 
someone else, if we know that someone. So, we need to know his life, 
what happened to him, how he thinks. In other words, in a way, it is 
more important to describe how your character means than where he was 
born, or who killed his mother How did he feel in the most important 
moments of his life? How will he act now? Those are the questions you 
should think when you are writing about your character.

A history does not have to be long, though a one paragraph history will 
hardly say much about your character. A history should be as long as you 
think is necessary to describe your character's way of thinking. And 
that is as important to you as it is to us.
 
Let me give you an example to illustrate what I mean:
 
A history that says 'I was born in an elven village, saw my parents be 
killed by orcs, and left to explore the world' can have many different 
meanings. One, your character might hate orcs now, for what they did. 
Second, he may love them, if his parents were such monsters that their 
deaths were a blessing to your character. Three, he may have suffered 
with his parents deaths, but then he realized his parents left him an 
enormous inheritance and, ah, well, pity they died, but life goes on.
With that example, I hope to have shown you that your character 
psychology is what makes a difference between your elf and another 
player's elf. As you describe how your character think, his actions, his 
alignment begins to make a lot more sense. Often, it is the history that 
defines his alignment, that retouches it, and explains why someone is 
evil, good, lawful or chaotic.
Thus, a History's purpose is to tell, not only us, but you too, who your 
character really is. Its purpose is to help you make a full character, 
with some idiosyncrasies of his own, and allow you to have the most 
possible fun with him. Its purpose is to make your character more than a 
bunch of bytes.

- `#`CDefine your character's `Wpersonality`C. Go deeper than alignments, add 
idiosyncrasies, quirks, and the kind (help history-info).`^
- Your character must have a `#`Wlife goal`^, everyone does. It may be simple or 
complex, but he/she must have a reason to live. Revenge as a character's only 
goal should be avoided, since that is a short-termed goal, and usually a side 
one.
- A history has a minimum requirement of `#`W30 lines `^(around 400 words).
- Your character should be `#`Wactive `^in your history - do not keep him/her 
sitting, watching events happen before him/her.
- Work out your character's `#`Winterests`^. Think of hobbies, work, and what else 
he/she does in life apart from killing mobs. Do not kill your character of boredom 
by keeping him studying spells and skills non-stop all his life.
- Unless there is a good reason to, you should know your `#`Wrace`^, and some of its 
mythos (help race).
- All characters are born in `#`WMythrin`^, in one of the existing `#`Wkingdoms`^ 
(help kingdoms). Your character cannot come from other worlds, or fictitious realms.
You can choose one of the main cities (help cities) of Mythrin, or think of a small 
village, which you can name as you seem fit.
- Unless there is a reason not to, your character has a `#`Whome`^, a place he/she 
came from.
- You cannot `#`Wdestroy `^your character hometown, by any means.
- All Mythrin gods are in `#`Whelp god-list`^. Do not "create" new gods in your 
histories, and treat them as if the whole of Mythrin follows them. If you want to 
have a particular view of the world, talk to an immortal `#`Gprior`^ to writing 
your history.
- There is no such thing as `#`Wreincarnation `^from one character to another. 
Memories disappear when a character dies permanently (that is, permkilled 
or deleted).
- You cannot be of any `#`WNPC race `^(help npc-races).
- The only races that can `#`Winterbreed `^are listed in 'help interbreeding'. No 
other race combination can produce offspring.
- Remember you begin at `#`Wlevel 1`^, in a town (Mekali or Dzagari). Find a good 
explanation for that, and keep in mind that it is impossible for your 
character to be the most powerful mage among elves.
- Keep in mind your beginning is `#`Whumble`^. Most don't know you, so you are not a 
great hero in these part of the world. Also, you cannot be a `#`Wking`^, prince, 
emperor, or any ruler of any part of the world. Nor the son of a `#`Wgod`^, nor the 
favorite paladin of a goddess. If you want to be something, build that out IC.

 Some mobs, within dangerous autoquests, will only recognize and react to

Immortals running quests that may lead to some sort of loss will check if 
you are a quester, before taking you to danger.  Some autoquests will not
be able to be done by non questers.  And the immortals will have less 
tendency to actively promote questing with non questers when players
that are questers are logged on.`+

 Non-questers will be respected (by both mobs and immortals) in their wish 
to not be involved in any quest that may harm them in some way.  `+

 Be careful, once this status is turned on, it cannot be turned off!  And 
to get it removed will cost you at least `#`R-5000xp`^.  `+

Note: For your information the original reason for the quester came from

the way they think it should and that they were dragged into the quest
without wanting to be.  If you are that type of player please do NOT

`#`cRules: 
1.   `^All descriptions must fit into a fantasy world setting.  
`#`c2.   `^All items must be either trash or furniture.  The later must have 
normal healing bonuses.  
`#`c3.   `^All mobs must be level one, and must not have any additional 
immunities, offensive flags, etc, that are not naturally part of the race 
(ie, a cat is naturally fast, so that is allowed; cats that have permanent
sanctuaries would be unthinkable).  
`#`c4.   `^All normal building rules apply here (such as no proper names in room's 
names, etc).  
`#`c5.   `^Things must follow common sense - that means no elephant pets.  
`#`c6.   `^It is allowed to have a small plaque with the house's owner name on the 
exit description to his door.  
`#`c7.   `^Doors must be normal ones, no special locks allowed.  
`#`c8.   `^Rooms must be normal ones, no 'no_recall', 'noscry', etc, rooms.  
Healing bonuses must also be normal.

houses, forever.

                        `#`WCharacter Traits`^
 
When creating your character, you will surely imagine him/her with a specific 
personality, with quirks, and an original way to see the world. You might also 
imagine him/her with some interesting physical attributes that will add some 
spice to your roleplay.
 
This list of traits is here to help you choose those special aspects of your 
character. They are mainly suggestions, you are free to think of new ideas, as 
far as they are consistent with our settings (fantasy, medieval one). If you 
wish to discuss any new ideas, send a `#`Wnote to rp`^.
 
As you will see, some of the traits have alignment restrictions. That means if 
you have one of those, you cannot choose that trait. Some of them may not be 
strictly in accord with your own view of that trait - human psycology is 
complex after all - but that's how they will be treated in this game.
 
In order to be letgained, you will have to choose at least 3 traits. 
50% (rounded up) of your traits must be personality traits.

`YRPSupport role:`^
To help, within their power, players that ask for small quests, directions for 
their characters, advice on alignments, rp items.
 
`#`GPersonal quests:`^
When creating a quest for a player, RPSupport must not involve gods, deities, 
or any high powers of Mythrin. If there is a need for such involvement, the RP 
Council must approve in advance.
When RPing, motes making mobs react to you are allowed, taken such an action 
suits the mob. An example:
 "amote laborer nods at @, who totally ignores her."
Such motes should not, however, who some special power. Ex: 
 "emote gathers the shadows around him."
While IC, the RPSupport character is a normal character, just like all others.
 
`#`MDirections and advices:`^
The RPSupport should always give council when requested, or when a blatant 
confusion of IC and OOC is detected. RPSupport is not to take any punishment 
measures. Any trouble should be reported to the immortals.
 
`#`BRP Items:`^
RPSupport can load the template rp item and restring it to whatever is needed, 
with the following restrictions in mind:
- all descriptions must be in accord to Mythrin's fantasy setting;
- if there is a worker (ex: a weaponsmith) in the game, RPSupport should direct 
the character to that worker, instead of creating a restrung item;
- try to keep the creation of restrung items to the essential, instead of 
abiding to every request.

in extreme cases you'd do something to hurt it (ex: respect: children).

negative alignments whatsoever. If 'respect: murder', cannot have positive 
alignments.

him live?

to bow before you than for you to change your mind.
 
`#`CStammer:`^
During those crucial moments of your life, whenever something important is at 
game, you find yourself unable to easily communicate.
 
`#`CTrue love:`^
You found the meaning of that in your life. It is what gives you strength to 
go on, when everything seems lost.
 
-align restriction: no negative alliances.
 
`#`CWeak will:`^
You are easily manipulated by people, your opinions are so weakly exposed that 
they hardly convince anyone, yourself included. You are usually unsure about

text `#`C         The Jobs Project`^
 
This project allows players to have jobs ic, and make money out of it. Since 
a job requires producing something, in game terms a job means building 
something on olc. Jobs would include weaponsmiths, bakers, publishers, house 
builders, etc.
 
Players earn money with this system by selling what they crafted, ie built on 
olc. That results in the player owning a shop, near one of Valarin's main 
cities.
 
It is required that those interested in a job/shop either know how to build in 
olc, or know someone who can help them.
 
To apply for a job/shop, you should write a `#`Wnote to Master Reyortsed`^ or to 
`#`WMaster Skrynlaeth`^ (Mekali and Dzagari mayors), cc to `#`WRP`^. In your 
application, you should include:
   - olc experience
   - ic reasons
   - ic background showing your skills (ie, how did you get to know about 
     weapons, etc)
     
The project is coordinated by Minyae and Mirgro.

`#`MShops Rules`^
 
Rules for building a shop are very simple. The main purpose of thi system is 
to allow you to have customized items, and having fun, and not to have level 
150 swords ;)
 
Items built must abide to the following rules:
 
  - they must follow the balance rules, including price (read `Yhelp item-price`=?);
  - they CANNOT have modifiers, bonuses or special flags (like vorpal);
  - they must be in agreement with our fantasy setting (no guns and the like);
  - they must have acceptable shorts (no 'The Sword of Ogre Killing').
 
Magical items (scrolls,potions etc) can only be sold if you have those skills, 
making the shopfront an appearance only. In other words, you will not build 
those items on olc, but rather make them ICly.

text ..
`#`mGetting yourself an olc area
----------------------------`^
 
`#`b1.`^ Once your application has been accepted, you will be given an area on 
the olc port, where you will build your shop rooms, the merchandise you will 
sell, and the necessary OOC tools to make your shop work (see below).
 
`#`mWhat must be built
------------------`^
 
`#`b2.`^ The rooms that form your IC shop. There must be at least one room, like 
ordinary shops in Mekali and Dzagari. That room must be bought by as per `#`Whelp 
ic-house-price`^, meaning the you also have a right to one object and one pet 
(nothing like a parrot in a shop to attract customers).
 
`#`b3.`^ The items that you will sell. These must be built according to `#`Whelp 
job-rules`^. Note that shops specialise in one product, not products of 
different types. Although they can sell variants of the product... ie, a 
bookshop cannot sell alchohol as well, but it can sell journals, magazines, 
newspapers etc.
 
`#`b4.`^ An OOC room, where all your merchandise will be reseted, and where an 
assistant will be, ready to answer your call (see below).
 
`#`mHow does the shop work
----------------------`^
 
`#`b5.`^ In the olc port, there is an area 'Example of a Shop', open to anyone who 
wants to visit it. In there, there is a little shop, with one item made, and, 
more importantly, the mprogs you will need. Take a look at them, and create 
similar ones in your own shop.
 
`#`b6.`^ Your assistant is a shopkeeper (remember to make him able to see the type 
of item you craft), who will answer your call only (the mprogs mentioned above 
are name-restricted). In the main port, it will be from him that you will get 
your items.
 
`#`mBuilding the OOC room and your assistant
----------------------------------------`^
 
`#`b7.`^ You need the assitant room, the mprog_mob and those mprogs in order to have 
the ic system working. You can customize them (description, what the assistant 
says, etc) to your linking, though.
 
`#`b8.`^ Items must be reseted in the assistant room.
 
`#`mFinishing your shop
-------------------`^
 
`#`b9.`^ Once you are finished with it, note the coordinators, telling them you're 
done. Your shop will be checked and once a week (at max, less if it isnt 
required) it will be port over to the main port.
 
`#`b10.`^ You can build more items later, as they are required. Just note us 
again, requesting a recheck, and report of your area.
 
`#`mSelling items ICly
------------------`^
 
`#`b11.`^ Once the shop is built, it is linked to a location near one of the 
main cities (players can choose near which city).
 
`#`b12.`^ Once in your shop, you call your assistant, and buy the items from him/her.
There are two reasons for this: 
  - game balance: items can't get into the game for free;
  - rp - your char bought the materials he used from his suppliers. Since there
    are no built suppliers, this situation simulates that.
    
`#`b13.`^ After you buy your items, you simply dismiss your assistant, sending him 
back to his ooc room. It is important that the assistant goes away, in order 
that no one else buy from him, and get the items you created.
 
`#`b14.`^ With the items in hand, you do with them whatever you like. You can sell 
them for whichever price you want, or give them, or use them for rp.
 
`#`mNotes
-----`^
 
`#`ba:`^ Players can have furniture in their shop, at the same prices as per `#`Yhelp 
ic-house-price`^.
 
`#`bb:`^ The assistant is not the real shopkeeper (that's the shop owner, the char 
himself). He is an ooc-type of shopkeeper, whose function is to keep game balance (ie, 
no free level 90 swords around).
 
`#`bc:`^You do not have to pay for the supplier room.`^

text Nickel was born in 1158 to gnomish parents Brumblelar and Dehrani Khevac, 
who both were in service to an accomplished human mage by the name of Jeval. 
Prior to Nickel's birth, the Khevacs lived with Jeval in his secluded estate 
in the outskirts of Osparatch, Elenarthia.  Brumblelar was an adept tinkerer 
and was recruited by Jeval to assist him in artificing endeavors. 
Specifically, the mage wanted to perfect artificing by imbuing gnomish 
inventions with sorcery -- a practice much frowned upon in the Khevacs' 
hometown.`+
`+
Jeval warmly received the wee gnomish tot, and Nickel was raised in a loving 
environment for many, many years.  (He was named after his grandfather, but 
given the human translation in honor of Jeval's heritage.)  Alas, there came 
a time when Jeval grew old and frail.  When Nickel was at the tender age of 
32, Jeval's died.  It was a heart-breaking time for the three gnomes, but 
they persevered.  Having inherited the estate, Brumblelar and Dehrani 
continued with the experiments, having been taught some of Jeval's sorcerous 
ways.  For many years thereafter, they instructed Nickel in the basic 
theories of magic -- well, as much as his youthful mind could comprehend.  
He seemed to be an adequate aspirant.`+
`+
Eventually, there came a time when Nickel finally did understand the 
underlying theories and workings of magic.  However, his parents' limited 
expertise in the Art was insufficient for Nickel to graduate to actual spell 
formulation and execution.  It was at that time, at the age of 60, that 
Nickel left his home in search of an apprenticeship with a mentor or mage 
guild.  Jeval had spoken often of the school of magic in Mekali, and so that 
is where Nickel set his sights for.`+
`+
For weeks, the gnomish adolescent traveled to the port city that would give 
him passage across the seas to Valarin.  It was during these travels that 
the heretofore sheltered lad met with his first taste of the cruel, 
unforgiving lands.  He was attacked by brigands and barely escaped with his 
life, having thrown his gold and silver about to break off the chase.  When 
he reached the port city, he was broke, cold, and hungry.  Accordingly, he 
ended up working odd jobs for several months to earn enough money to 
purchase passage to Valarin.  -- He was too ashamed to return home defeated.`+
`+
Finally, Nickel had the funds for his trip and eagerly set voyage to the 
distant lands.  More misfortune befell Nickel, however.  During the long 
voyage, a pair of orcs sought to pass the time by menacing the poor gnomish 
lad.  Nickel was beaten up on several occasions, and often spent days locked 
in his tiny, shared stateroom to avoid the bullies.  It was not a pleasant 
time.`+
`+
Nickel's expedition ended finally on Day of Mist, 13th the Month of Light in 
the year 1219.  He had arrived in Mekali.  The past few months had changed 
him in many ways.  Nearly beaten in self-loathing for his vulnerabilities, 
Nickel set out to make his parents proud and to become and accomplished mage 
-- like Jeval -- so that he may one day return home and work once again with 
his parents and their artificing experiments.

text Oextend is the restring of extra descriptions.  When you create an extended 
description on an object, the former extra description are ignored, and the 
extended becomes the new valid description, when looking at the object.  `+
`+
Once created, extended descriptions can be edited much the same way as 
extra descriptions.  The syntax is: `+
`+
OEXTENDED object mode keyword ...`+
`+
Where mode can be: `+
`#`yadd clear copy edit remove rename tag`^ `+
`+
`#`=? add - adds a new keyword with empty description.  `+
`=? appendkey - appends keywords to existing keywords `+
`=? clear - clears ALL extended description on an object!  `+
`=? copy - copies an extended description from another object.  `+
`=? edit - puts you into the description editor for keyword.  `+
`=? remove - removes an extended description.  `+
`=? rename - renames keyword to new keyword.  `^ `+
`+
Thus, to create a new extended description: `+
`+
`#`Woextended object name add blue`^ `+
`+
A keyword can be more than one word, just put the words between '' (use 
the 'x y' syntax).  `+
`+
After creating the keywords, you can edit the description the same way you 
do with extra descriptions, using the `#`yedit`^ mode.  `+
`+
The mode `#`yremane`^ replaces all former keywords, by the new one(s).  Once 
again, if more than one new keyword, put them between ''.  `+
`+
`#`=? `#`Woextended <object name> add 'blue flower'`^ `+
`=? --> adds one extended description with the keywords 'blue' and `+
`=? 'flower.  `+
`=? `#`Woextended <object name> rename blue 'white scepter'`^ `+
`=? --> changes the keywords of the extended description from 'blue and `+
`=? 'flower' to 'white' and 'scepter' `^ `+
`+
When copying an extended description, you cannot put more than one 
keywords into the copied description, so you need to `#`yappend`^ new keywords 
afterward.`+
