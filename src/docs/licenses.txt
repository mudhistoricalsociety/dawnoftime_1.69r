In compiling, or using any of the Dawn code in this release either in part 
or full, you have agreed to the following restrictions:

1.  If a particular source code module has reference to any of Dawn's 
    parent codebases at the top of the module... you are bound by all 
    the license agreements in this file... otherwise just the Dawn 
    license applies.

2.  The Login Notice ('help greeting' by default) of your mud must 
    contain following credits:

    Based on Diku by Hans, Katya, Tom, Michael, and Sebastian.  
    MERC 2.1 by Hatchet, Furey and Kahn.  ROM 2.4 (c)1993-1996 
    by Russ Taylor, Oblivion 2.0 (C)1996-97 by Wes Wagner.
    Based on The Dawn of Time v1.69r by Michael Garratt (c)1997-2004.

    This information must be in the last 23 lines of your login, and no 
    attempts should be made to hide this information.

    It is also suggested that you may want to display:
       This mud is based on the Dawn of Time codebase.
    some where in the login process, this however is not mandatory.

3.  The use of the names 'The Dawn of Time', 'Dawn', and 'DOT' remain the 
    property of Michael Garratt.

4.  You must obtain permission to release a derivative of the Dawn codebase 
    from Michael Garratt.  Contact can be made using the website at
    http://www.dawnoftime.org/

5.  If you register your Mud on any mud database, and the option is 
    avaliable to specify that your mud is Dawn based, you must do so.
    i.e. 'Dawn' is an available codebase option on mud connector, 
    you must register using this - This condition remains intact until the
    end of 2006.

6.  You must leave the contents of 'help credits' in help credits... after 
    2006 you may move the Dawn related contents into 'help CREDIT-DAWN'
    The following must ALWAYS appear at the bottom of 'help credits'... and 
    CREDIT-DAWN should be added to this list if you move the Dawn credits.

 >  The credits of the parent codebases are located in their own help entires
 >  per codebase as listed below.  
 >
 >  See these help files for the credits from parent codebases: 
 >    CREDIT-DIKU CREDIT-MERC CREDIT-ROM CREDIT-OBLIVION     

7.  The Dawn of Time codebase can NOT be used to host an adult mud, muds 
    dedicated to distributed pirated software, pornography, software cracks 
    or copyrighted music.

8.  Michael Garratt reserves the right to revoke use of the Dawn codebase 
    from any mud if the mud is being used for illegal or unethical 
    purposes.  In addition the right to use the codebase may be revoked 
    from muds that are reflecting negatively on the dawn mudding
    community at his discretion.

// START OBLIVION LICENSE
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
In compiling, or using any of the code in this release either in part or full,
you have agreed to the following restrictions:

1)  Full compliance with the DIKU, MERC, and ROM licenses enclosed in this 
    distribution, even though the version of ROM 2.4 used was the first beta
    release, in keeping with the intent of Russ Taylor's newer license, 
    the newest version available at this time of that license(ROM 2.4b4) will
    be used.

2)  The Login Notice of your mud must contain the following credits:

    Based on DIKU by Hans, Katya, Tom, Michael, and Sebastion, MERC 2.1
    by Hatchet, Furey and Kahn.  ROM 2.4 (c)1993-96 by Russ Taylor and
    OBLIVION 1.2alpha copyright 1996 by Wes Wagner.

    This information must be in the last 23 lines of your login, and no 
    attempts should be made to hide this information.

3)  Before opening an Oblivion based MUD or MIRPG you must send email to
    Wes Wagner(airius@dnaco.net).  Failure to do so may result in your rights
    to use the code being taken away.

4)  Any use of the Term OBLIVION, remains the exclusive right of Wes Wagner.

5)  Anyone wishing to release a derivative of the OBLIVION code, must obtain
    permission from Wes Wagner in writing.

6)  Wes Wagner reserves the right to disallow anyone who he feels has been
    practicing unethical administration the ability to use the OBLIVION
    code base.
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
// END OBLIVION LICENSE
/**************************************************************************/


/**************************************************************************/
// START ROM LICENSE
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
In compiling this code, you have agreed to the following restrictions on
any operating version of ROM code:

1) following all guidelines in the diku license (contained below)
2) following all guidelines in the Merc license (contained below)
3) The login message to your mud must contain a notice that it is based
   on ROM 2.4 beta, copyright 1993 - 1996 Russ Taylor.  The help files
   must include a ROM entry, readable by all players, and unaltered
   from the file included with the source code, except as authorized
   by the ROM authors.  The login screen means the screen you see when
   you first connect, excepting one-line "Do you have color?" messages,
   and the readable by all players means it must be viewable by both
   new and old characters on a 24-line terminal with no scrollback.
   To make it more clear, you cannot put the credits on the top of
   a 24-line ascii graphic, as this would cause the credits to
   scroll off.  In any case, final decision on compliance/non-compliance
   with this requirement is left soley to the judgement of the ROM
   consortium.
4) Before opening a ROM-based mud, you must send email to the author
   (rtaylor@efn.org), so that I can keep track of sites for
   future code releases.
5) Any use of the term Rivers of Mud remains the exclusive right of
   Russ Taylor, this includes the sole right to release future versions 
   of ROM source code, and the title Rivers of Mud and ROM as pertains to
   a mud.  Names such as John's ROM, AnotherROM, and JustaROM are also
   forbidden.  Permission to use the name Rivers of Mud has been granted
   to Zump, the current ROM implementer, his mud will remain the only one 
   with that privilige.  As a coder, you have full rights to release your
   own derivatives of the ROM code, provided they follow the restrictions of
   this license, contain all appropriate README and credits files, and are
   properly labelled as being derivatives of the ROM 2.4 code (just as ROM
   is itself a derivative of Gamma 0.0 and Merc 2.1 code).  
6) Anyone not wishing to follow terms of the ROM license shall be obligated
   to delete all copies of this code in their possession.  This includes, but
   is not limited to, failure to display full credits for ROM, Merc, and Diku.
7) Collaboration with known Diku, Merc, or ROM license violators on any
   ROM code project is strictly forbidden without written permission from
   the ROM consortium (Russ Taylor, Gabrielle Taylor, and Brian Moore).
   This list includes, but is not limited to, Mike Krause (Vryce),
   Derek Snider (Thoric), and any other administrators involved in the muds
   Medievia and Realms of Despair. The second restriction may be lifted
   after a period of 1 year has passed with Derek Snider in full compliance
   with the Diku and Merc licenses.

(In English, this means that Alander is the only one allowed to release
ROM source code, as apposed to ROM derived source code, and that you
cannot call your mud ROM even though it uses ROM code.  You also aren't
allowed to deal with code thieves)

If you have any questions about this license, please send email to
rtaylor@efn.org.

=== Copyright and License Terms

Diku Mud is copyright (C) 1990, 1991 by Sebastian Hammer, Michael Seifert,
Hans Henrik St{rfeldt, Tom Madsen, and Katja Nyboe.  Their license agreement
is in the file 'license.doc'.

Merc Diku Mud is a derivative of the original Diku Mud and is subject to their
copyright and license agreement.  Merc Diku Mud contains substantial
enhancements to Diku Mud.  These enhancements are copyright 1992, 1993 by
Michael Chastain, Michael Quan, and Mitchell Tse.

In order to use Merc you must follow the Diku license and our license.  The
exact terms of the Diku license are in the file 'license.doc'.  A summary of
these terms is:

	-- No resale or operation for profit.
	-- Original author's names must appear in login sequence.
	-- The 'credits' command must report original authors.
	-- You must notify the Diku creators that you are operating a Diku mud.

Our license terms are:

	-- Copyrights must remain in original source.
	-- 'Help merc' must report our help text, as shipped.

Notice that our license terms don't include keeping our names in the login
sequence.  If you want to keep a line in there referring to Merc, or referring
to us by name (Furey, Hatchet, and Kahn), we'd appreciate that, but we don't
require it.  But you must keep the original Diku authors in the login sequence.

If you do not follow these license terms, we will ask you to comply.  If that
doesn't work, then we will talk to your system administrators (not about your
running a mud, but on the grounds that you're using our copyrighted software
without permission).

These are very generous terms for any software.  If you don't want to accept
them, feel free to run some other software, or write your own.

This document contains the rules by which you can use, alter or publish
parts of DikuMud. DikuMud has been created by the above five listed persons
in their spare time, at DIKU (Computer Science Instutute at Copenhagen
University). You are legally bound to follow the rules described in this
document.

Rules:

   !! DikuMud is NOT Public Domain, shareware, careware or the like !!

   You may under no circumstances make profit on *ANY* part of DikuMud in
   any possible way. You may under no circumstances charge money for
   distributing any part of dikumud - this includes the usual $5 charge
   for "sending the disk" or "just for the disk" etc.
   By breaking these rules you violate the agreement between us and the
   University, and hence will be sued.

   You may not remove any copyright notices from any of the documents or
   sources given to you.

   This license must *always* be included "as is" if you copy or give
   away any part of DikuMud (which is to be done as described in this
   document).

   If you publish *any* part of dikumud, we as creators must appear in the
   article, and the article must be clearly copyrighted subject to this
   license. Before publishing you must first send us a message, by
   snail-mail or e-mail, and inform us what, where and when you are
   publishing (remember to include your address, name etc.)

   If you wish to setup a version of DikuMud on any computer system, you
   must send us a message , by snail-mail or e-mail, and inform us where
   and when you are running the game. (remember to include 
   your address, name etc.)


   Any running version of DikuMud must include our names in the login
   sequence. Furthermore the "credits" command shall always cointain
   our name, addresses, and a notice which states we have created DikuMud.

   You are allowed to alter DikuMud, source and documentation as long as
   you do not violate any of the above stated rules.


Regards,



The DikuMud Group


Note:

We hope you will enjoy DikuMud, and encourage you to send us any reports
on bugs (when you find 'it'). Remember that we are all using our spare
time to write and improve DikuMud, bugs, etc. - and changes will take their
time. We have so far put extremely many programming hours into this project.
If you make any major improvements on DikuMud we would be happy to
hear from you. As you will naturally honor the above rules, you will receive
new updates and improvements made to the game.
