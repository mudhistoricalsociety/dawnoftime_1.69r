Opening the book you read:
 
           `#`rAarislan, Legend of the Lost Children`^
 
A tale is sometimes told to children, by their parents, desperate to instill fear in an effort to make their child pay more attention, that if one were to daydream too often, their very souls would be taken to another land, a land that is far above the clouds, where the daydreams of children can run rampant, and a land where there would be no return if a child were ever to go there. It is said that the faeries, who take a natural liking to children, fly about looking for children who spend their days and nights daydreaming, and when one is spotted, it is then that their faerie magic takes the child to this new, and mysterious land.
 
Of course, that is only the parents' version and the tales children tell amongst themselves about this land, are indeed quite a different story. In fact, many children, for the very reason of living in a land without parents to tell them what to do, will often spend their time daydreaming about such a place. A place where they can eat all the sweets in the world, and dance with faeries, and ride ponies all day long. For them, this wonderful tale is a constant longing to be made into a reality.
 
But then, it is only a tale, for could it really be true, that such a place, filled with lost children and sugar faeries could really exist? Is there really a land above the skies, called Aarislan, and if you were not a child, would it still be possible to find it? Perhaps if you ask one of the wise faeries, they might know how to find it.
