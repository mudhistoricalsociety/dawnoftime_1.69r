hand on tiny holders on the walls and the strong smell of incense fills the

covers what seems like a tiny entrance.  Bright yellow stars and half moons 
are roughly sewn on the cloth, an almost gaudy tribute to the world of 
magic.  A large handcrafted wooden `#`ysign`^ hangs on one wall.  It is surrounded 
by candles and looks a bit singed from the dripping wax.

Name Corner of Bashem and Muhkck Roads~
Desc Two alleys converge here, heading south and west.  The path is covered with 
trash, and is not very smooth.  There seem to be fewer travellers on this 
path, and the ones who do pass by, avert their eyes and scurry past, pulling 
their cloaks around them.

Name Bashem Road~
Desc You are on a narrow back alley just west of the north gates.  There seem to

Name Cap in Hand ~
Desc This cluttered shack has several crude displays of cheap cotton garments, 
and implements for cleaning and mining.  There is a large orc bossing a 
whimpering half-elf about, as he sits back and watches him do all the work.  
In coarse script, painted across the wall, are the words:`1`1 `#`S"Get that slave working - cheap mining picks for sale here!"  `^

#27102
Name Black Market~
Desc Just off the road, a make-shift structure has been built from planks of 
unused wood and scraps of iron, blocking it off from surrounding buildings.  
This shady part of the town seems to be where the townfolk sell their 
"acquired" goods on the black market, for prices to steal for.

RoomEcho  5 23   5 A large orc wanders into the market, ready to sell some blades he has acquired, for a high price.~

Name Cheap'n'Nasty~
Desc This crowded, junk-strewn shop sells a variety of items, all looking 
suspiciously cheap, as though there must be some flaw with them.  A short 
kobold eyes you up when you enter, ascertaining whether or not to approach 
you with some fine jewellery or shiny armor.

Name Inside North Gate~
Desc You are on a trash-covered street just inside the north gates of a large 
city.  The gates themselves stand wide open, and through them you can see a 
muddy wasteland.  The street runs south into the center of the city.

#27105
Name A Burnt-Out Shop~
Desc Cracked windows, and grey-smoked walls are what's left of this shop.  
Vandals have looted most of what was left after the shop was set on fire, 
and there lie only piles of ashes with an occasional scrap of cloth peering 
through.  The wind blows through where the back wall used to be, where only 
a few bricks remain standing.  In the eastern wall, there is a large crack, 
perhaps where the shop safe once was.
