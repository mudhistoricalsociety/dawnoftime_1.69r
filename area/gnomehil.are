Desc This gnome is big and burly, a very odd trait for a gnome.  His full beard, 
and thick mustache are a silver-grey.  His hair is full, and thick, making 
him almost seem like a dwarf.  His arms ripple with muscles, and his armor 
and hammer are polished to a gleam.  He has a kind look in his eye, but a 
frown on his face.  He looks like he'd help anyone in need.
