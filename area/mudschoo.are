one wall filled with dusty novels and manuscripts.  On the adjacent wall 
hang a display of weapons in all shapes and sizes.  Judging by the lack of 
sheen on the weapons you can tell that they are well used.

mq6 rsay In fact, there's probably a helpfile for almost every topic you can think of.
mq9 rsay So whenever you get stuck, this is the first place to turn to.
mq12 rsay You can search for a topic by using `#`Shelplist`^ with the keyword of the topic.

title adv. lesson 16 - things to get involved in~
code mq1 rsay There are many exciting things to get involved in, once you start playing here.
mq4 rsay You could join a `#`Sclan`^ (help clan) or the world of `#`Spolitics`^ (help politic).
mq7 rsay Maybe you could buy a `#`Shouse`^ (help ic-house-price) or set up business and buy a `#`Sshop`^ (help jobs).
mq11 rsay Of course, you could be involved in `#`Spkills`^ (playerkills) but there are strict rules on this and pkilling is `#`Srestricted`^ (help pkill).
mq14 rsay And there are `#`Squests`^ to be part of, and `#`Sautoquests`^ to solve (help autoquest).
mq17 rsay Lastly, there's always plenty of opportunities to get involved with roleplay situations.

title adv. lesson 14 - areas~
code mq1 rsay There are many areas in the land of mythrin, all of which are original to Dawn.
mq4 rsay You can see a list of the `#`Sarea`^s which have the recommended level range next to them, using the `#`Sarealist`^ command.
mq7 rsay Some areas are designed for specific purposes such as roleplay areas (which has [[all] beside it), and others are designed for killing monsters (these have the level range beside it).
mq12 rsay When you get started, you'll arrive at a place which is your `#`Srecall`^ point.
mq13 rsay This means, that whenever you `#`Srecall`^, you'll come back to this place.
mq16 rsay Forest-type classes, such as rangers, druids and barbarians, recall to a forest spot near the crossroads.
mq18 rsay Good races, such as humans and elves, recall to Mekali.
mq17 rsay Evil races, such as gnolls and kobolds, recall to Dzagari.
mq22 rsay Each area has its own hunting area for low level places.
mq25 rsay In Mekali - the park, Dzagari - the post office, Crossroads - forsaken gardens.
mq27 rsay A word of advice.. its generally frowned upon to kill citizens in Mekali, find the park instead.
mq30 rsay You can use a map for directions or ask someone you meet to help you.

mq3 rsay Its useful to read `#`Shelp`^ on the `#`Smythos`^ because it can add to your character's roleplay and history.
mq7 rsay The setting of dawn is medieval fantasy.
mq10 rsay The world of Mythrin also has its own gods and goddesses.

mq4 rsay There is `#`Shelp`^ about the `#`Srace-list`^ and `#`Shelp`^ to view `#`Sracial-skills`^.
mq7 rsay When you create a character, you choose both a race and a class.
mq10 rsay Depending on your combination, this will decide how much experience you will need to level.
mq14 rsay To see which races are best suited to which classes, have a look at the `#`Shelp`^ on the `#`Srace-overview`^.
mq18 rsay If you want further information on a race, you can look at the `#`Shelp`^file on your `#`Srace-<race_name>`^ and `#`Shelp`^ on `#`Srace-myths`^.
mq22 rsay To find out more about classes, have a look at the `#`Shelp`^ available for that `#`Sclass_name`^.

title adv. lesson 10 - leveling~
code mq1 rsay Part of the fun of playing, is going up levels.
mq4 rsay There are 101 levels on D.o.T, and up to 91 levels are available to mortals.
mq8 rsay You go up levels by gaining experience.
mq10 rsay This can be done by roleplaying, moot rewards, killing monsters, being part of a group which kills monsters, or when your skills increase through use.
mq14 rsay The amount of experience needed before you reach the next level is determined by your creation points.
mq16 rsay Creation points are based on your class and race combination, and by the amount of skills you gain during creation.
mq18 rsay To get the minimum number of experience (xp) to level, use up to 40 creation points.
mq20 rsay When you raise a level, you are given 2 trains and 3 pracs which you can use to gain new skills or increase your skills and statistics.

title adv. lesson 9 - short/long descs~
code mq1 smile
mq2 rsay When you see other players in the game, what you see is similar to a real life situation in that you would see "a tall woman" or "a stout, bearded man".
mq5 rsay We call these `#`Sshort descriptions`^.
mq8 rsay A short description is what you see at first glance, and describes in one statement, your race, gender and any distinctive features.
mq12 rsay Having a short description helps you to be recognised by other players, and is also necessary before being letgained.
mq14 rsay To get a short description, you'll need to write a `#`Slong description`^ and then ask an immortal to set your short description.
mq18 rsay A `#`Slong description`^ is a paragraph (of at least 5 lines) detailing your appearance, and describes everything you would see by looking at you.
mq21 rsay However, it cannot describe aspects such as the things you wear, as these change from day to day.
mq25 rsay When you are writing your long description, imagine you are describing a still photo of yourself.
mq29 rsay If you are a race other than human, having a look at the `#`Shelp`^ available on `#`Srace`^s may help you to describe your appearance.
mq23 rsay You can look at the `#`Shelp`^file on `#`Slong`^ descriptions to learn more about this, and how to use the editor to write your description.
mq35 rsay [with a smile] When you're ready..

title adv. lesson 8 - letgains~
code mq1 rsay As this is a roleplaying mud, we have a system called `#`Sletgain`^ing to encourage players to put a little thought into their characters.
mq4 rsay All players need to be letgained before level 25 or you will not get any more experience until you are.
mq7 rsay To `#`Srequestletgain`^ you need to write a character `#`Shistory`^, fill out your character's `#`Srpsheet`^ and have a `#`Sshort`^ and `#`Slong description`^.
mq12 rsay A `#`Shistory`^ is the life story of your character up to this point, and gives insight as to what type of person they are and what their goals are.
mq16 rsay You can find out more `#`Shelp`^ about `#`Shistory`^ requirements and `#`Shelp`^ on `#`Smythos`^ to help you with your character's history.
mq20 rsay Each character has an `#`Srpsheet`^ which needs to be filled out in order to be letgained.
mq24 rsay Rpsheets record details about your characters personality and physical traits, and you can find out more `#`Shelp`^ about `#`Srpsheets`^ also.
mq27 rsay We'll cover short and long descriptions in the next lesson.

title adv. lesson 7 - alignment~
code mq1 rsay When you create a character, you choose what alignment your character will roleplay.
mq4 rsay Your character's alignment is based on their values and beliefs, and determines how they will behave and respond to certain situations.
mq7 rsay You must roleplay your character according to their alignment at all times, and good roleplay of your alignment can result in moots (xp bonuses).
mq10 rsay There is more `#`Shelp`^ available on `#`Salignment`^ if you need it.

mq4 rsay When an imm or newbie helper sends you a tell, you can respond by sending a `#`Stell`^ to the `#`Sname`^ of that person.
mq8 rsay If you were sent an anonymous message, you can respond by `#`Sreply`^ing with your message.
mq12 rsay To send a tell to an immortal, or newbie helper, you can send a `#`Stell`^ to the `#`Sname`^ of that person with your message.
mq16 rsay You can `#`Sreplay`^ to see if you've been sent any tells.
mq19 rsay There is more `#`Shelp`^ on sending and receiving `#`Stells`^ if you need it.
mq21 rsay Using tells is for ooc communication only.

title adv. lesson 4 - channels~
code mq1 rsay There are four channels used to communicate with other players anywhere in the game.
mq4 rsay The channel most relevant to you at this stage is the `#`Snewbie`^ channel.
mq6 rsay This is the channel especially for players that are not yet letgained, to get their questions about the game answered in a helpful friendly way.
mq6 rsay Immortals and newbie helpers will be able to help you on this channel.
mq9 rsay Type `#`Snewbie`^ before your message to use this channel.
mq13 rsay The `#`Sooc`^ channel (out-of-character), which looks like this `#`c<name ooc>`^ is for discussing real life issues only.
mq16 rsay You can use this channel by typing `#`Sooc`^ before your message.
mq19 rsay If you have a specific question regarding MUD game mechanics, you can type `#`Squestion`^ before your message, to use the `#`gquestion and answer`^ channel.
mq22 rsay This channel is also an `#`Sooc`^ channel.
mq26 rsay To go to a designated ooc room, type `#`Sgoooc`^.

mq4 smile
mq10 rsay Oh, and by the way.. there'll be a test on the rules at the end of this school.

title adv. lesson 1 - who's who?~
code mq1 rsay There are many people who make up the Dawn of Time.
mq2 rsay >$n Firstly there's you, one of the players, also called `#`Smortal`^s because you can die in the game.
mq2 emote chuckles mischieviously.
mq7 rsay Then there are `#`Simmortal`^s (because they cannot die), who are the people in charge of making the game run smoothly.
mq7 rsay Immortals do everything from `#`Scoding`^ to `#`Squests`^ to `#`Sroleplaying`^ with mortals.
mq12 rsay You can find out more about immortals by looking at the `#`Swizlist`^.
mq17 rsay If you type `#`Swho`^ you'll see a list of everyone on at the current time.
mq21 rsay Names above the pink line are mortals, below are immortals.
mq26 rsay If a player has `#`S[[+++]]`^ next to their name, this means they are a newbie helper and will be able to help you with any questions you may have.
mq30 rsay Another group of players are the `#`Snobles`^. 
mq35 rsay These players have been recognised for their outstanding roleplay and have the ability to reward other players who are doing well at roleplay, with experience points or `#`Smoots`^.
mq40 rsay Another important group of people are the `#`Sbuilders`^, made up of both mortals and immortals.
mq45 chuckle
mq45 rsay That's quite a team, you can find out more `#`Shelp`^ about `#`Swho`^ is on D.o.T if you need to.

#7342
title adv. lesson 3 - ic/ooc~
code mq1 rsay There are two aspects to the Dawn of Time.
mq4 rsay The `#`Sic`^ (in-character) aspect is where you play the game, talk to other characters, roleplay and lead the life of your character.
mq8 rsay When you are playing the game, all actions and words must be `#`Sin character`^, for example, staying at the inn, going by horse and carriage, wearing a suit of armor.
mq12 rsay The opposite is the `#`Sooc`^ (out-of-character) aspect.
mq16 rsay `#`SOOC`^ means topics you would talk about to someone in real life, or actions you would do in real life, for example surfing, watching movies, wearing a pair of jeans.
mq20 rsay The only times you can talk or act `#`Sout of character`^ is when you are talking over the `#`Sooc channel`^ or in a designated `#`Sooc room`^.
mq24 rsay This is one of the rules of D.o.T and both players and admin will pull you up on it if you are having trouble following this rule.
mq24 emote grins with a twinkle in his eye.

code mq1 rsay >$n Dawn of Time is a roleplaying mud, which means roleplaying is required, not optional.
mq4 rsay >$n Roleplaying, or rp, means to act and talk like the character you have made.
mq7 rsay When you are roleplaying, this is called `#`Sin character`^ or `#`Sic`^.
mq10 rsay Doing a great job at roleplaying can result in `#`Smoots`^ which are xp bonuses to encourage your good roleplay skills.
mq14 rsay You can get more `#`Shelp`^ about `#`Sgoodexample`^s or `#`Shelp`^ on `#`Sbadexample`^s of roleplay to really get the hang of this.

mq6 rsay You need to `#`Sfollow`^ your friend, so that they can add you to their group.
mq9 rsay If you're feeling brave and want to lead a group of friends, make sure your friends are following you.
mq12 rsay Then, if your friends name is Sam, you can `#`Sgroup Sam`^.
mq15 rsay When you are part of a group, you will share each e`#`Sxp`^erience.

mq10 rsay If you're feeling a little `#`Swimpy`^ you can set your `#`Swimpy`^ to a minimum number such as `#`S5`^ if your maximum hitpoints is 10 so you will automatically try to flee when your hitpoints get down to this number.

mq3 rsay It tells you the directions available, the time in the game, your current and maximum hitpoints and movements, and how much experience you need to gain before you reach the next level.
mq6 rsay >$n You can find out more `#`Shelp`^ about your `#`Sprompt`^ if you need to.
mq10 rsay Your `#`Sscore`^ also tells you this kind of information.

mq5 rsay If it seems like an easy fight, you could `#`Skill`^ the `#`Smosquito`^.
mq5 rsay >$n But first, take a look at your prompt to make sure you're in good health (maximum hp).
mq9 rsay >$n If you notice your hitpoints going down fast or getting close to zero, you can `#`Sflee`^ from the fight before you die.
mq12 rsay There's a chance you might not be able to escape on the first attempt so just try to `#`Sflee`^ again until you leave the room.

mq6 rsay >$n Its a good idea to `#`Strain`^ your endurance, or `#`Sh`^it`#`Sp`^oints `#`S(hp)`^ and depending on what you intend to become, you can train some other attributes.

mq7 stand
mq10 rsay Rest, and sleep are very important.. if you're feeling like you can barely move, or have ended up with a few bumps and bruises, there's nothing like a good sleep to replenish the body.
mq14 rsay Its important to listen to your body too, if you are `#`Sfeeling tired`^, perhaps you should rest a little, but if you're `#`Sfeeling very tired`^ its best to get a good sleep.. it could be a little embarrassing to collapse in the middle of the street (hopefully someone will be kind enough to `#`Swake`^ you if this happens).

mq19 rsay If its lying on the ground you can `#`Sget`^ the `#`Sobject`^, but if its inside something, like the key was, you'll need to `#`Sget`^ the `#`Sobject`^ from the `#`Scontainer`^.
mq21 rsay See those flowers there, you can `#`Sget`^ a `#`Sflower`^ if you're not fussy, or if you can `#`Sget`^ the `#`Sred`^ one, if you like red, or you can `#`Sget`^ the `#`Siris`^ if you prefer.
