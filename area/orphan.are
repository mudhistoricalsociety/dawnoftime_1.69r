`#`CUnicorn's doom`^ 
 
 
Unicorns are creatures of nature and of magic.  They exist since the dawn 
of times (*giggle*), having been created by no god or entity.  They were 
born when the first sun ray shone, when the first rain drop fell, when the 
first living being breathed, when the first fight occurred.  Each element of 
nature (plants, animals, time, weather, sun, among others) gave birth to an 
unicorn.  At first, they were formless, being just the essence of each 
element.  As time went on, and the world defined its forms, so did the 
unicorns, and they chose the form they now bear: that of a magical horse, 
with a shinning horn.  Why they chose this form is another tale, to be told 
another time.  
 
 There 15 unicorns.  One for each of natures elements.  Each represent also 
one aspect of magic, or one sphere, as it is often called by the mages.  All 
unicorns have great magical power, but they master their element, with skill 
that mortals cannot even grasp.  Except maybe for the Magi...  But that's 
also another tale.  
 
 The unicorn's power comes from the land, from nature.  There has been a 
time that unicorns drew their power from all the world.  But that has changed
a long time ago...  
 
 When the world was still young, and the races were still learning about 
its wonders, something happened.  At that time the gods were young yet, and 
maybe not as wise as gods should be...  One of them, and I will not mention 
names here, thought that he deserved more then the others, he wanted power.  
Now, when the world was created, a lot of power had been needed.  What 
better way to get power, then to drain the world itself from its energy?  
For a while, the other gods didn't realize what was going on, and even when 
they sensed something wrong, still they were manipulated to think nothing 
was really wrong.  Yes...  That god was really good at this.  
 
 There came a time, though, when they could not be blinded any more.  Well, 
to be brief, soon the gods were at war.  A war between gods is something 
more dreadful then the worst of nightmares.  Not measuring spells and 
incantations, they fought each other.  Their energy ran free on the world.  
Uncontrolled, this energy formed a great wave of divine power, devastating 
most of what was in its way.  
 
 The land was not being destroyed, but instead all of its magical power was 
being drained.  The unicorns saw all this, unable to interfere.  They tried 
to fight this negation of magic, but it was useless.  They were defeated, 
and only survived because some parts of the world were still unaffected.  
Weakened as they were, they knew they would not survive another struggle, so 
they followed the only option left - they fled.  And run they did, to the 
most remote parts of the world.  There, summoning all power they still had, 
they created islands of magic and nature.  Each chose a place of their 
liking, a lake, a volcano, a valley, and concentrated all their energies 
there.  The unicorns knew they were dooming themselves, even if they 
survived, for those places would be their weak point.  If ever destroyed, 
they would die.  But they had no choice, and they waited, to see if death 
would come to the world.  
 
 Meanwhile, a goddess saw what they had done to the world.  Ayeni was her 
name, and she was the wisest and more learned of all the gods.  She cried 
for the others to stop, and then they all saw it.  In despair, else all they 
had created be destroyed, they tried to stop it.  When all efforts resulted 
in nothing, Ayeni suggested that they united themselves.  Even the one who 
had started it all joined the others.  This was perhaps the only time when 
all gods fought together.  But even this was not enough, and they were 
losing...  
 
 When all seemed beyond hope, Chaos, the goddess of all and nothing, quite 
like the chaos that you created here'.  Then, turning serious, 'but 
this was not meant to be'.  
 
 'You are young, you don't know yet what you are doing in this world.  Look 
at all you have created, and that now you are destroying.  But I am pleased 
to see that, in the end, wise you became.  Also, you have put differences 
behind to fight for something greater...  This world.  You have shown your 
strength.  That is why I will end this.' 
 
 And so, she stopped the wave.

`#`CUnicorn's doom - Part 2`^ 
 
 
'Forget not what you learned today.  ' And with these words, she was gone.  
The gods looked at each other, no words said, and then went to a safe place, 
to heal their wounds.  If they understood what was said, if a lesson was 
learned indeed, it is not known, but some say that the gods may have 
forgotten some of what they saw at that distant past.  
 
 The world began to heal too.  Slowly at first, but time heals all, so life 
eventually returned to normality.  Or almost.  For the unicorns, it would 
never again be the same.  They had survived because, at the very end, Ayeni, 
who was very fond of them, protected the unicorns.  But all their power was 
sealed in a tiny land, and they would have to protect it at all costs.  From 
that moment on, they almost never left their places of power, and they would 
watch the world, and act, from there.  
 
 These lands, of course, are not normal ones.  They have been affected by 
the unicorns power, and reflect now the unicorns element.  Animals and 
plants that live there have been bestowed with unicorns wisdom, and they are 
sentient and can talk.  
 
 Nill Uni, of Time, lives in a valley where times goes on slower then the
rest of the world.  
 
 Unar, of Fire, lives on a deep vulcan, where birds of fire fly and fire 
worms crawl under lava roses.  
 
 Anver, of Air, lives in a floating island, made of clouds.  Her only 
company are the eagles that fly high in the sky.  
 
 Stea, of Water, hides in a crystal lake, surrounded by fishes.  
 
 Ambion, of Earth, dwells a cave deep in earth, almost never seeing the 
light of day.  
 
 Ellarte, or Weather, dwells the highest mountain , where snow, rain, fog 
and sun alternate in chaotic patterns.  
 
 Osten, of Plant, lives in the heart of a dark forest, where the silence is 
so intense, that one can hear a leaf falling.  
 
 Iwlar, of Animal, chose a foggy swamp to live, where strange animals can 
be seen.  
Ytery, of Law, built a tower in her land, and there she dwells, surrounded 
by books and lizards.  
 
 Wescal, of Sun, lives in a oasis, deep in the desert, where the sun hits 
hard the land, and is almost never annoyed by clouds.  No life can be found 
there.  
 
 Hilion, of Combat, dwells a ravine in the mountains, a perfect place for 
an ambush.  Animals who go there get mad and start fighting all who passes 
there.  
 
 Tryss, of Healing, rests at the origins of a river.  There a sweet music 
can always be heard, and small birds fly all over the place.  
 
 Sahal, of Creation, chose a small island to live.  An island so small, 
that you almost cannot see it.  But who enters there, never leaves again, 
for the island seems not to ever end.  
 
 Stini, of Protection, lives on the sea, deep in the water, well protected 
from the world.  So protected, that loneliness is her only companion.
Kasai, of the Wild, was the only one not to put his power on a land.  
Instead, he sealed it within himself.  And now he walks the world.  
 
 
 I do not know what would happen if an unicorn was killed.  They are so 
tuned with nature and it's elements, that i fear all the world would feel it 
somehow.  Maybe a flicker of the element?  I do not know and I believe even 
the unicorns know not.  But one thing is sure.  If the element is not 
destroyed, a new unicorn would be born, for the unicorn is part of the 
element as much as the element is part of the unicorn.  
 
 There have always been unicorns, and unless the gods change the world 
laws, there will always be unicorns...

of Death.  
  <Death bad!> 
 
 As time passed, he realized that the consequences of the war were much 
more serious than he had thought at first.  There had been to many deaths in 
the war, and the mortal survivors, in their struggle to live, killed even 
more animals, and plants, not worrying much in raise or plant more.  In 
their despair, they killed themselves for a piece of bread.  
  <That is awful!  Me doesn't want sad story!  Me wants a happy one!> 
 Death continued to rule everywhere, he realized, at the same rating as 
life was losing its grasp on the world.  
 
 The cycle of life/death was broken.  Mellyn knew that death could only 
come from life.  
  <No!  We protect life!  Grrrrr!  No death!> 
 Without life, the cycle would soon end, and he would be no more.  He was 
already a lot weakened by the lack of living beings in the world, and now he 
feared for his existence.  
 
 He had to restore life.  Thus, he created a seed.  It glowed with divine 
power.  Then, he looked for a good place in Mythrin, and he chose a valley, close to the homes of four unicorns.  
  <Unicorns?  Unicorns!  Unicorns!  Unicorns!> 
 There, he planted it.  
 
 In a few moments, a huge mushroom...  
  <Mushrooms are delicious!  Yummm!> 
  ...  Had grown from it.  It shone in a pale golden light.  
  <Beautiful...> 
 Its spores are said to be magical, and to bestow special powers to those 
who eat them.  Under this mushroom, from time to time, a special flower 
blossoms.  Each flower is of a different color, and a different smell.  They 
are among the most beautiful sights one can imagine.  They are the mothers 
of the faeries.  From within each of these flowers, a faerie is born.  
  <Hey, that is me!  Me is faerie!  Faeries are cool!> 
 
 Andromeda, called Mellyn the first faerie that was born.  She was blessed 
with divine powers.  She is the faerie of light and life.  
  <Andromeda is golden!  She shiiiiiines!  Like the sun!> 
 Mellyn instructed her to protect the faeries, and above all, to care for 
life.  
  <Me likes life!  Me likes!>
The next four faeries to be born were special too.  They are silver 
faeries, and the unicorns taught them the secrets of the elements.  
  <Shiny horses with a stick on their heads!  Hihihihi> 
 Selenia deals with fire she was born during summer, and has a dragon as 
friend.  She loves gold, but no one knows what she does with it.  
  <Selenia smart!> 
 Pix has the powers of water, having been born in the winter.  
  <Me!  Me!  Lilantra is me!> 
 Tylara, the faerie of spring, masters air, and Titania, born in the fall, 
has knowledge of earth.  Lastly, there is Lilantra, who is master of the 
essence of magic.  She received her knowledge from all the unicorns.  
  <Faeries good!> 
 
 Faeries come from life, they are life and they protect life.  They aren't 
much larger than the palm of the hand, and have colored wings...  
 <Mine is full of stars!  Look!  Aren't stars pretty?> 
...  And hair.  
  <Cyan wings!  Like mine!> 
 They are little spirits, sweetly smiling at you...  
  <Me smiles!> 
  ...  At one moment, biting you at the next.  Ouch!  They travel the world, 
unseen to most eyes, protecting life.

`#`BThe tale of the Princess and the Fool
 
 
O`^nce upon a time when the world was young and elves ruled Mythrin, 
there lived a beautiful princess by the name of Celaire, the only child of Gibrahil, ruler of the 
Silver Elves of Endomar, the most powerful of the Kingdoms, sheltered 
in the Great Forest. Now elves as a race are comely, but Princess 
Celaire was a beauty as Mythrin had never seen and perhaps never will 
see again. Her hair was like threads of gold, soft as webspun silk and 
her features were so exquisitely fashioned she was almost blinding to 
look at. Most extraordinary however, were her eyes.  Some say when 
she first opened them, the gods paused in their mighty deeds to study 
the blue of her tiny orbs. Others say that the ocean itself went so 
mad with jealousy over Celaire's eyes that it wiped out three 
continents! Some even say, the storyteller's voice lowers to a 
reverent hush that her eyes contained the essence of Mythrin 
itself.
 
Despite her exquisite beauty, Celaire was a disappointingly ordinary 
princess vain and petty and proud, as princesses tend to be. She 
broke the hearts of the men who came to woo her or sent them on 
impossible quests to win her favor which usually ended in their 
 
deaths. She asked princes to go to war, promising her hand to the 
victor. But she was wise, this princess and she chose her victims 
carefully. So evenly matched were they that when the war was over not 
a man was left standing.
 
Yet her countenance was so lovely to the eye, her sweet voice so 
melodious to the ear that no mortal man could resist her. So they 
continued to fight and to die. 
 
But as you all know children, the wheels of justice, though they may 
grind slowly, grind well. 
 
<The storyteller shifts in his seat, trying to ignore the cold chill 
in his bones.>
 
One day a stranger came to the castle. He was bedraggled, dressed in 
a terrible suit of bright yellow and green squares. Small silver 
bells were attached to the end of his too long shoes as well as to 
the top of his floppy jester's hat. 
 
"I come" he announced, bowing grandly to the King "to play the 
fool! For a mere pithy of food and fine wine I shall entertain this
illustrious court with countless tales and fabulous magic... or 
countless magic and fabulous tales!" 
 
He immediately began pulling flowers from his sleeve and riding 
around on a unicycle (also produced from his sleeve) juggling a 
multitude of colored balls. 
 
Needless to say, everyone in the Court of Endomar was delighted. 
That is almost everyone. 
 
"Send him away father" Celaire whispered fiercely to the King "he 
is ugly to look at for his chin is long. He is a most unpleasant creature."
 
 The King reproached her with a look "judge not others for their 
countenance daughter, for it is not in beauty which true greatness 
lies. He makes thy mother laugh and amuses me and so thee shalt 
forbear him."
 
So the fool stayed on, amazing the Court anew each day with the wit 
of his tongue and the skill of his hand.
Despite herself, the princess began looking forward to his visits. 
She began to seek him out, to engage him in conversation. His stories 
were delightful, but she found his views on philosophy and theology 
even more so. His ideas were so unique, his train of thought so well 
crafted that he put the wise men in her father's court to shame. What 
is more, unlike the other elves in the realm who seemed to interested 
only in her face, this fool seemed enchanted with her mind. He taught 
her the source of true magic and found in this princess a gifted 
mage. The King was delighted with her progress, her sudden talent in 
the arcane and her new found craving for knowledge.
 
Things seemed to be going well.
 
Then one night as the princess and the fool sat by the marble 
fireplace of the palace's grand Hall, the fool suddenly asked 
"Princess fair, you have won my heart. Will you be mine?"
 
Celaire stared at his homely face in amazement then laughed. "I shalt 
never be thine," she admonished him "for I am a princess and thou 
art only a fool."
 
The fool nodded sadly and turned away.
For a year and a day, this continued. Each day they would talk and 
learn but each night he would ask the same question "Princess fair, 
you have won my heart. Will you be mine?"
 
And she would answer "I shalt never be thine, for I am a princess and 
thou art only a fool."

Finally, on the last day of midsummer, the fool again asked his 
question. But this time the princess, deciding she had had enough 
said "First, thou must prove thy love to me by climbing the glass 
mountain of Avalen and pledging a blood oath to love only me."
 
The courtiers gasped, knowing this to be impossible. But the fool 
only nodded and turned away.
 
The princess smiled, convinced she was rid of him forever.
 
But after a fortnight the fool returned, his hand bandaged and a 
distinctive shard of glass in his open palm. The task was done. 
Looking at her, the fool asked his question. 
 
The princess stared at him a moment, no suitor of hers had ever 
returned from a quest! But she quickly regained her posture, "First, 
thou must prove thy love to me by making me a gown from the rays of 
the sun and the jewels from the Age of Wonder."
 
The courtiers gasped, knowing this to be impossible. But the fool 
only nodded and turned away.
 
In a fortnight the fool returned, a shimmering dress in his scarred 
hands. Again he asked his question.
 
By now the princess knew something was exceedingly amiss, and felt 
hopelessness welling within her, yet she persisted. "First, thou must 
prove thy love to me by making me a circlet from the tail hairs of 
Sahal, the Unicorn of Creation."
 
The courtiers gasped, knowing this to be impossible. But the fool 
only nodded and turned away.
 
And, as he has done twice before, the fool returned, the prize in his 
scarred hands. 
 
Celaire knew then that there was nothing she could ask that he could 
not give.
 
"Princess fair," the Fool asked softly "you have won my heart. Will 
you be mine?"
The princess looked into his eyes and realized she had fallen in love 
with the fool. But as she opened her mouth to give consent, her pride 
overwhelmed her. How could she, the most exquisite of elves, child of 
the great house of Endomar, love a fool? It could not be! She 
replied then  "I shalt never be thine, for I am a princess and thou 
art only a fool. That is my final answer."
 
"Always?" 
 
"Always."
 
Suddenly the winds howled as if in mourning and the waves of the 
jealous ocean crashed against the castle walls.
 
And the fool stood, growing in stature till he was no longer a fool 
but Reyortsed, one of the seven sons of fire. "Thy pride has consumed 
thee Celaire," he thundered "thou didst not heed thy father's words. 
Now thou stands in the presence of a God not a Fool. Prepare to meet 
thy doom." But as he looked at her, his heart melted with love. He 
remember his pact with Avalen and, as Gods could be bound by oaths 
just as mere mortals could, he knew he too was doomed, for he could 
love only her. 
 
"Come," he told Celaire softly "take back thy answer and throw away 
thy arrogance. For despite all thine faults I love thee. Be mine and 
all shalt be forgiven."
 
But Celaire's soul was filled with pride and she could remember only 
that she had given her final answer.
"No" she said, her voice steely with determination "I have given my 
final answer thou shalt never have me."
 
For a moment it seemed then as if all the realm screamed in anger. 
The wind howled and the ocean raged, and the very earth shook. Then 
all was a quiet calm.
 
"Thou wouldst put at risk thine very life for thine pride" 
Reyortsed's voice was soft as an adder's hiss "thou art an overgrown 
child! Very well, if thou wilt insist on acting like a child," his 
pointed a finger at the princess "then forever shalt thou be one!" 
 
Without warning the elven princess vanished from the castle into 
legend, never again to be seen by the Silver Elves of Endomar. 
 
In her pride the Princess had been punished, doomed to be a child 
forever. But the greater punishment lay in denying herself the only 
man she had ever loved and in that she has only herself to blame.
