looking closer, you notice that you can see him with extradordinary detail,
even though it's pitch dark. Only then, you realize that this being is darker
than darkness itself. He is tall, has very long dark hair, is clad in full
plate armor and bears the ingisnia of the Magi in his chest. You can't make
out his face, but you obviously notice he is Kephlen, High general of the 
forces of Bohr, the magi, because of the amazing similarity in his armor, and
the one you saw two rooms behind, in a great painting on the wall.
All you can see inside of his helmet, are two yellow glowing eyes gazing at
you coldly.

Years, decades passed on wich Chleon arranged alliances and build the
strenght of her kingdom on the goal to end Darkhate. In the end, she gathered
what is said to be the greatest army ever. Three million soldiers. Four
hundred mages, all under her command. Magic, at the time, was still developing
into what it was to become, but there were already some capable of amazing
feats. Among them, Chleon's first counselor: Bohr.

    They still sing tales of this battle, of three million men and a magi
against a shadow dragon. And the shadow dragon almost won. About three hundred
men survived, Chleon among them, but, in the end, it was Bohr who, staying at
the back lines, analyzed the pattern of the dragon and devised the glyph that
evem today keeps him arrested. They say that, were Darkhate not exausted from
the battle, he could have whitstood Bohr's prison.

    But he did not, and so ended Darkhate. The golden plains, on that day,
turned into the wicked and dark place they are now, called the valley of
blood. Chleon erected a castle upon Bohr's prison, and meant it to be only
a minor prison.


The book goes on and on, from there on the castle went from owner to owner,
until it happened so that Bohr, the old Queen's counselor, managed to get the
castle for himself after he battled the former owner, a Mage called Pharen,
and won.
And the book ends here.

ExtraDesc chapter1~
At first, before the building of this castle, all this place was known as
the golden plains, for here grew trees with golden leaves and silver fruits.
At the center of the golden plains, stood the little town of Valderna. It was
a town made by a farming people that lived from the abundance of life this
valley offered. However, such abundance made the denizens of Valderna a lazy
and prejudiced people, and they grew to become quite xenophobic.

    At one time, came to the town a strange man, like none had ever seen
before. He had dark skin, something completely foreign to these people, dark,
penetrating eyes, he kept to himself and barely spoke. His appearance and his
demeanor brought him the suspition of the townspeople and he soon found his
life here disturbed by unending bickerings and undesirable comments from all
around. He would have leaved town for good, but when he was on the way out, he
saw and helped a teenager girl get rid of a band of street robbers who were to
become rapers. It happened so that she lived in Valderna, and so he brought
her back, and earned her love.

    The townsfolk had to accept the man after he saved young Anyia, and so he
lived with them, and Anyia, enduring the ironies and malitious comments of his
lover's friends. Little time went by, and soon the people's prejudices spoke
higher and the man's life got indeed unbearable. In a town fight, he ended up
killing one of the town's residents, one of Anyia's friends. With this, the
town went after him, but Anyia stood beside him. She tried to help him, but
they were many, and he ended up letting himself get caught. Anyia was
desperate, for she knew they would kill her lover. She went out of town, to
seek for help with the imperial guard on the capital, but on her way out, she
was attacked and murdered by the same group of robbers who first tried to
steal from her, way back.

    Her death came to Valderna on the day that strange man was going to be
executed. He went crazy, attacked the guards, killed them, killed all who
stood on his way. One man, two man, ten man, unarmed, armed, whoever came, he
slaughtered, and only on the end the few remaining citizens realized the
reason for his power: He was a dragon, a polymorphed dragon on a human shape.
He killed men, woman and children, all inhabitants of Valderna met death that
day.

    The capital of the kingdon. at the time called Cotrin, was ruled by King
Erard. Without news from Valderna on quite a while, Erard organized a small
expedition to go see what was the matter. They never came back. He then sent
another group, and another, and another... and none returned. At last, one
day, a scout from one of the sent groups managed to survive the slaughter and
arrived with news about the situation: The town was destroyed, the valley was
taken by an aggressive Black Dragon as dark as shadow itself... a shadow
Dragon.

    King Erard organized a great war expedition for Valderna, and invaded the
golden plains with more than one hundred thousand men. None survived. The
Dragon, called by all Darkhate, slew them all. Erard himself died there. His
wife, Queen Chleon, who took over the throne, took for herself the task to put
and end to this Dragon once and for all.

ExtraDesc book I Magi~
This book tells of the order of Magi and its hierarchy. You open in a session
sumarizing their concepts:

    ...and thus, we, the Magi, are so organized. The inner circle, composed of
the older and more powerful of our members, is the core of our society. They
are responsible to lead the magi all over the world into greater ideals and
goals. Presently, the inner circle is composed of thirteen members, all of
them very honorable and powerful.

    The order itself was founded in three thousand, eight hundred and seventy
four by three mages: Cromnus, Nigros and Asteron. Of these, Asteron is now
dead, killed by the Magi Demos, in revenge for his twisting of the natural
forces of the world. Today, the order is composed of more than one hundred
thousand mages from all of the known continents.

    Every Magi of the inner circle is responsible for 24 pupils, the sum of
wich composes the outher circle. The outher circle is made of very powerful
mages who devote their lives, time and even self towards the order's causes.
The outher circle learns magical theory straightly from the inner circle, and
is at the inner circle's availability to use into any honorable mission
regarding the order's objectives. Needless to say, personal goals and
political bickerings have no saying in such an enlightened order as ours.

    Outside the outher circle, we have the rank of Masters. These are one 
thousand or so mages who managed to master one realm or sphere. They study
with the mages on the outher circle and are watched over by them.

    Beyond the rank of adepts, there is the rank of Adepts. The Adepts are
mages who managed to raise into a higher position in the order. They are good
at many spheres, and must have mastered at least five different spells. The
Adepts learn theory from the outher circle.

    At last, but not least, there are the Apprentices. These are the most
numerous of the order, and most enter the Magi just to be able to use of it's
position's privileges. The apprentices learn theory from the masters, but are
mainly free to do whatever they wish, with the only obligations to never
engage in combat with a fellow magi, and never refuse a request for help from
another magi. Bad use of this privileges are punished with exile from the
order.

    At greater ranks, there are greater privileges and obligations, but I will
not enter in such details here to preserve the sigil of the higher mages.

    Not all mage of the land is a member of the order of the Magi. The order
does not accepts people who are not willing to abide by their laws and order,
and mages who have not managed to master at least one spell. I can say,
roughly, that about fourty five percent of the mages today are Magi, the rest
are either too puny to be of any notice, or are enemies of the order.

    We fight for Knowledge. Let it be available to anyone, let it be used with
wisdom. The good guidance of the inner circle have already led us into an age
of wonder and power that will be remembered forever. We are the merging force
that will control the world in the next millenium age, for our order is
founded in solid and powerful laws.

    The theory presented is based on the fourth planar hemispheres on the
crystaline ressonance of the stages where the constants of Balthazar and
Casper are neglected by the flow of...

And then the book goes into an ever-growing confusion of formulas and names.

ExtraDesc fall zorven book~
This book tells about the anatomy, powers and history of what seems to be a
God named Zorven. You open in a page without many technical details and read
on:

    And so it was that Zorven ruled over the Netherworld of tortured souls by
seven thousand, seven hundred and seventy six years. And it was then that the
prophecy of Haakyla, God of Prophets, made itself clear.

    For then, Zorven met and fell in love with a mortal named Kilith. As if it
wasn't enough, though, he then decided to wed Kilith and make her a
demigoddess, something that shocked all of the other Gods. Zorven's image on
the divine reals went down, and Kaali, then Mistress of Death, arranged to
frame Kilith on a ridiculous attempt of murder. All the Gods knew Kilith 
wasn't stupid enough to do it, but they saw there the perfect opportunity to
ban Zroven away and cast him forever on the material plane as a Fallen God,
and so they did.

    And then Zorven and Kilith came down and started living on the physical
world. However, Zorven was quite mad at the Gods, and decided to get his
revenge telling the Magi the secret to affect divine essence. The Magi
immediatly got interested, and Zorven taught the inner circle on several
occasions, on several secrets he possessed. However, it is said that when he
was about to tell the one secret of that wich the Gods feared most, all the
Gods above gathered and decided to end Zorven's revenge for good, and so they
elected a champion, imbued him with the item called "The Staff of
Righteousness", created by the power of all Gods combined, and sent him to
seal Zorven forever on his Netherworld, where he would never escape.

    The battle raged for three days, but, in the end, the God's champion
managed to arrest Zorven on the netherworld. When he was being cast down,
though he uttered his death curse, that all Gods would die and he would rule
in their place.

    The Magi then created a portal to the Netherworld in the place known as
the temple of the seven flames, and used it to talk to Zorven for some time
thereafter, but no further insight was given by him, and so he was left to his
prison, until this day.

    It is said that a powerful spell was woven that will release Zorven when
the Last of the Gods will die. Wether this is true or not, the fact is that
Zorven is arrested, and few today would care to release him.

After that, the book enters into some very boring technical data over dates
and Divine anatomy...

ExtraDesc chapter2~
From this point on the religions wich I studied became very confusing, as
each places their Gods before the others. So now I will restrain myself from
presenting a cronological order and simply state who the other Gods who came
to be are. To avoid any preferences, I will present them in alphabetical
order:


    Anita:
    Goddess of the Mrems, she is daughter of Maya and Garlen. Mainly a small
Goddess at first, she had her power greatly increased when she created her
own race. Race creation, by the way, seems to be the preferred method that
the Gods have to grow in Power.

    Ayeni:
    Goddess of Wisdom, there is still a lot of debate over wether she came
before or after the creation of intelligent life. Ayeni seems to be, though,
one of the elder Goddesses, and with a powerful reasoning, to match (and some
even dare to say overcome) that of Kalthos himself. She is said to once have
gathered all the strenght of the Gods to prevent a world-wide destruction
wich they have wrought.

    Arhat/Mellyn:
    He is quite confusing. Arhat is refered to as God of Rebirth and
Tranformation, and also God of evolution. Mellyn is referred to as God of Life
and Death, however, their references are very close. Their psichology is quite
similar and they always seem to appear toghether, possibly meaning that the
purpose of life and death (Mellyn) is the wheel of evolution (Arhat), or that
both Arhat and Mellyn are in fact one only God.

    Garlen:
    God of Felines, Garlen was quite a puny God until he wed Maya, Goddess of
Lust and seduction and gained a place at the great council. Mainly, his voice
and power were dimmed by the birth of his daughter, Anita, who seemed to over-
power him in every aspect.

    Haakyla
    Known as Ladi fate, Ladi Luck, Goddess of seers, Goddess of Prophets, Ladi
of Sight, and many other names. Haakyla seems to rule the extra-sensorial
perceptions of people, something known as "the sight", something today fully
explained as a super-development of clockwise energies on the sixth energetic
lines over a person's pattern. Haakyla has foreseen many occurrences about the
Gods life, and some say she even predicted the Death of the Gods.

    Kaali:
    Mistress of Death, she was a minor God that ruled the act of death itself
until she became Goddess of Netherworld, by means of Zorven's downfall.

    Ladra:
    Queen of Air, the most powerful of all elemental Gods. She rules not only
the air, but also the western direction and the forces of electricity. She is
also known as Ladi of the Mind, as her power over the Air giver her the rule
over the intelligent mind, by correespondence.

    Lanthos:
    One of the most powerful of the Racial Gods, Lanthos, God of Elves, keeps
to himself and is not very interested in his brothers fights. Though his
power is revered and even feared by some, he chooses to stay with his fellow
elves, protecting them from an unseen and unexistant threat. He is also said
to be paranoid and Mad.

    Maya:
    Goddess of Seduction and Lust, Maya rules over the passions of men, and is
also known to rule over hatred and anger, as a natural consequence. She is
known to be the idiot who killed her daughter's family by calling forth a mage
called 'eternity', who has shown himself as more than a small problem.

    Sithimor:
    He is called the God of Lizards, and is clearly a case of a lower God who
managed to raise into a greater rank. He created his race and managed to
protect it for time enough so that they could give him strenght enough to make
him a greater God. However, he does not seem to have much voice on the greater
council.

    Zorven:
    Once God of the Netherworld, he now is locked in his previous realm,
unable to escape, for having wed a mortal and defying all of the other Gods.


    There are, also, many more Gods, but These I will treat on a later volume,
as information over them is very sparse and scattered. Also, I won't present
any information based on mere speculations, and will only announce the
existance of a deity after proven miracles on his part.
    Right now, my efforts are directed towards the elemental Gods, as they
seem to be very elusive, save for Ladra, who seems to make a great effort on
showing off.
~
ExtraDesc chapter1~
So, supposing, as I recalled, that the evidences I retrieved and their
current proves, wich I have already presented, are in fact true, I have
managed to form what must have been the first theory for the origin of the
universe, according to the Gods. Again, I say, much may be wrong, as many of
this evidence is still quite debatable, but this book presents, for the first
time, to the Magi community, a plausible theory of Who came before Who.

    At first, and there are many confusing parts here, there was the One. Now,
many today call this One Gaya, as Gaya represents all there is. We could day
that if the Gods were fighting, Gaya would be the fighting field. However, as
theory goes on, the first of the elements ever to be, before time and space,
and before existance itself, must have been Truth, therefore, it is my opinion
that Gaya and Allyn, so called Goddess of Truth, are one and only, meaning the
Truth is only found on what is natural and pure.

    From Gaya/Allyn, stem the first of Gods, who were, most probably, Kalthos,
God of Order, for if Gaya/Allyn was before All, the first of her manifestation
must have been the laws wich she was. And, being Kalthos the Order itself, one
can naturally guess that Order came first, since all in nature follows a
specific and quite determined order, though we may not know all of the
formulas yet.

    But Kalthos was not whole, for he had no purpose. Order itself is nothing
if there is not an element to be ordered. And then Gaya/Allyn saw the need for
a manifestation of order. But order itself could not be manifested because
order is not an ending, but a process in itself. What was needed was a mirror,
something to oppose Kalthos, and, in opposition, feed him with his own order,
and something that Kalthos would feed by his existance itself.

    And thus came to be Landeth, God of Chaos. And at the very moment Landeth
was created, the whole universe unfolded, for from there on there was the
differentiation, and things started forming, all things, from this duality.
Gaya/Allyn is the One above duality. It does not have an opposite force, for
she is her own opposite, and whole in herself.

    And for the creation of the Universe came Chaos, not The Chaos of Landeth,
but Chaos herself, Goddess of All and nothing, wich is the same as to say
Goddess of all, since we, the Magi, do not believe in Nothingness. From Chaos,
came the physical ground for the creation of all other Gods, and there was
creation.

ExtraDesc book were gods mages~
This book has many formulas and mathematical data wich is amazingly boring,
but some parts are still readable:

    And so it is that all evidenced points towards the fact that there is
nothing a God can do that a mage of enough power cannot too. Even the pure
creation of life, one of the grestest paradigms of our society, has fallen
when the Magi Demos was created by the gone Asteron.

    Therefore, it is this author's opinion that the Gods are indeed Magi of
a great power who managed to live on other realms. Not only, but one can see
the pattern emerging when, as magic grows in strenght, less and less people
go to the temples and churches of the so called Gods.

    So, it is not anymore a question of 'if' they are mages, but the main
question today is: 'why have they not stopped the advance of magic?', since
they knew that we would reach their position?

    Cromnus, High Magi of the inner circle, once stated: "It is a natural
process that the strong shall live and the weak shall die. However, it has
also been proven to us in more than one occasion that when the strong tries
to oppress the weaker, they only haste their fall, as the weaker gather
strenght and overcame the strong. Therefore, it is of the Order's opinion that
the Gods have not acted upon us because they know that, by doing so, they will
only hasten their fall. They are aware that their time has come, and are
waiting for us with all their power".

    This summarizes all, I think. I will ask for the readers to go back to
chapter seven and review the formulae for life creation as one can clearly see
the resemblance and similarities with the 'miracles' performed by Gods on old
times.

And from here on there is only more and more formulas...

ExtraDesc interconnected octogram~
Below the drawing of two interconnected squares, also known as octogram, see
written:

The octogram, as the representation of number eight, stands for the dual
aspects of the four. As four times two, eight represents the physical world
as it is, and all physical attractives. Material possessions, sex, comfort,
and all other aspects that are natural to physical life. Eight is the number
of physical life.
~
ExtraDesc heptagram~
Below the drawing of a heptagram you see written:

The heptagram, as the representation of the number seven,and can be viewed as
the joining of balance over matter, as three plus four, or the compreension of
the relative, as five plus two. Either way, balance over matter and the
compreension of the relative are one and only, for he who understands the
relative, also reaches balance over matter. And it all brings Power. Thus,
seven is the number of power. Not political or economic, but Inner strenght,
true Power. The power to resist all that is material, because one has already
found it's balance. The resisting of all temptations, the ascension of all dual
aspects.
~
ExtraDesc hexagram~
Below the drawing of a hexagram you see written:

The hexagram, as six, being two times three, stands for the balance found in
every bit of duality. As every dual nature finds within another aspect of its
same nature the balance, six stands for harmony.
~
ExtraDesc pentagram~
Below the drawing of a pentagram you see written:

The pentagram, as five, being the union of two and three, stands for the final
stage of evolution, where the relative, the two, joins with the balanced, the
three, all towards the one. Five is the number of marriage, as two represents
the male and three the female. Thus, as the final stage of life, the five
stands for full compreension and ascension, the birth of the perfect from the
imperfect.
~
ExtraDesc tilted square~
Below the drawing of a tilted square you see written:

The square is the representation of the four. Being two times two, and two
plus two, the four stands for the unfolding of the relative nature, of the
dual. As such, the four is the number of physical manifestation, and stands
as the base of patterns for the physical world. Four seasons, four cardinal
points, four phases of the moon, four elements. Four is the number of
manifested matter.
~
ExtraDesc triangle~
Below the drawing of a triangle you see written:

The triangle is the reunion of the relative, the two, with the absolute, the
One. Being the first balanced geometric figure on two dimensions, it also,
and mostly, represents balance. The dual, relative nature, that is always in
constant movement, towards the one. The three is the number of our present
dimension, and thus balance must precede all else.
~
ExtraDesc line~
Below the drawing of a line you see written:

The line, as the conection of two points, represents the two. The two is the
number of duality, of division, the first diferentiation of the one. The two
can stand for a conflict, as with all things relative, but can be seen as the
prelude of the three. The two represents the first manifestation of one, and
thus all things relative.
~
ExtraDesc circle~
Below the drawing of a circle you see written:

The circle represents both one and ten. It is the number of start, the
beggining. From the one, all cycles emerge, and to the one all cycles return.
The one, being one, represents the absolute, the One above.

ExtraDesc book~
This well-conserved book is Bohr's diary, and is chained to the desk. You open
it and start reading it. The first pages are rtaher uninteresting as he wrote
all of his annotations coded, and you can't make the code out. However, at some
point, he starts writing in common language. The book from this point on reads:


.Serenus, 13.

    Today I have announced to the inner circle my contact with the boing who
calls himself Zorven, the Eternal. This fallen God has agreed to help us in
our attempt to destroy the Gods by giving us the secret of God essence. Some
of our friends found it quite unnerving that this Zorven had appeared at the
very moment that we are in the need for a way to overcome the Gods, however,
his story does check, and I believe we will get their help.


.Ithanar, 7.

    News of Graviel's desertion were not happy ones for us. Graviel was quite
a god adept, though, and we will not take his desertion lightly, since other,
more soft adepts are also thinking of retiring the Order.


There is another set of coded pages, and then:


.Serenus, 21.

    Well, it does seems the Gods really made a good job on Zorven's prison.
Anyway, he cannot come for us, now, as we know he will after we sent his cute
daughter to the netherworld. Poor girl, she though she could create an army
against us, the Magi! Quite an irritating woman, this Auryan.


.Derranti, 3.

    That blasted Herkanna is getting ever the more ambitious. We had our pact,
but now she asks for specific victims, and such a lovely ones... Well, anyway,
I will do as she asks, since I still need her. Is she wants Kephlen's family,
so be it. I was indeed getting tired of that man's pitful compassion, not suit
for a general of the Magi.


.Ithanar, 12.

    One way or another it ends tomorrow. Tomorrow I will finish all my plans,
as the Gods will be defeated, that irritant Kephlen will die, and Zorven's
prison will finally collapse. The Uncreation spell is ready. We will have time
to deal with Graviel and Auryan's followers after we become Gods. I have
already set the linear power stages to ressonate with the inner pattern of the
higher octaves of essence within the sixth realm. Now, nothing will stop us.


... and that was the last entry.

some cosmic charts, depicting the flow of strange energies that these magis
mastered.

ExtraDesc purple~
As you look at the purple crystal, it seems to come alive with a strange,
twisting light. The image on the mirror then instantly changes into that of
the same room, but the room is on fire. Just before it, you see a small,
blonde man with dark eyes and a dirty face, seemingly exausted and hopeless,
holding the mirror in his hands. He looks through with a tired and
expressionless look.

You hear, then, a soft woman's voice:
"Emergency message recorded at thirteenth of Ithanar, four thousand, five
hundred and fifty four. Message from Kaladon of Darkhate."
The man draws a deep breath and starts saying:
"Hear me, you who look at this mirror... by now this castle is dead and gone,
but there is a secret... a deep secret I was not allowed to know, but must
keep... South of here... is the temple of the seven flames. At the center of
this temple, a gate stands open giving way to the Netherworld, where lies
locked Zorven, the Fallen God. To reach the gate, one must break the seven
seals... These are simple words... to be discovered by unveiling the poems
on each pillar. If you say the right word to the keeper... he will give you
the key to open the seal of the flame..."
He pauses, draws several breaths, and goes on, painfully:
"I am revealing this... because Zorven is a powerful threat. You, whoever you
are... must defeat him once and for all... But... simple spells will not
affect him... only the staff of righteousness... used by the gods to imprison
him... find it... and use it to end Zorven's life... While this is not done...
he will come again and again, and will always threaten all..."
And with this, you see a heavy stone falling in this man's head, thus killing
him. The image shimmers and fades away.
~
ExtraDesc green~
As you look upon the green crystal, a strange light comes from it, and the
image on the mirror just ahead of you changes its shape and transforms into
another image altogether. You see on the other side of the mirror a large
room, with eleven people gathered around a round table, looking intently at the
mirro. The one of the center, a tall man with short, dark hair, stands up and
adress someone behing the mirror.

Just before, though, you hear a soft woman's voice say:
"Last message recorded from fifteenth of Rosherum, four thousand, five hundred
and thirty one. Message from the Inner circle of Magi."
And the man speaks:
"Bohr of the magi, you bring heavy accusations upon this circle, do you have
how to prove them?"
"Yes, Lord Cromnus, I have. I have proof of Magorak's betrayal."
"And what proof is this?"
"The evidence I have consists of this crystal, wich has recorded a most
interesting conversation between Magorak and the Lord of the Dragons, plotting
your downfall. Also, this diary, taken from Magorak's high apprentice, in
wich the true face of this enlightened mage is at last exposed, and this
letter, signed by Lord Haakghen, golden dragon, where he testifies that he has
personally whitnessed the dealing between Magorak and Tiamat against all of
you."
"Very well, then. Teleport these evidences right away that we will commence
the judgement. You are commanded to remain in your castle until this is all
over."
"As you wish, Lord Cromnus."
"And... brother Bohr."
"Yes, Lord Cromnus?"
"If Magorak is found guilty, we will all owe you a great deal."
"Yes... lord Cromnus."
And, with this, the dark-haired, blue-eyes man sits down, raises a small smile
and the image shimmers and fades away.
~
ExtraDesc red~
As you look at the red crystal you suddenly notices a change on the mirror, as
the image switches to that of a very tall drow elven of advanced age, with
soft long white hair and an overwhelming big mouth. His small black eyes cast
a soft look upon someone behing the mirror.

You hear a soft woman's voice saying:
"Last recorded message from tenth of Serenus, four thousand, five hundred and
fifty four. Messave from Vendran of Darkwood."
And the drow elven says:
"Hail Bohr, brother of the Magi."
And you hear a voice coming from the other side of the mirror:
"Hail Vendran, master of evocation."
"What do you want, old friend?"
"I need a service from you, Vendran."
"Name it."
"Do you remember Zorven?"
"The fallen God that is imprisoned in your castle? How could i forget him?"
"It seems he has a daughter that is causing us much irritation. She is named
Auryan and lives now in the growing forest, arousing an uprising against our
order."
"Bohr, with all due res[ect, why bother with this girl? In some weeks we will
all be Gods, Then we will take care of her."
"Indeed so, I just don't like to leave open threads, that's all. Could you
take care of her?"
"What do you want me to do with her?"
"Bring her to me, I'll cast her in the netherworld."
"Why not simply kill her?"
"Zorven may find the strenght to do us in if we kill his daughter. By
arresting her with him, we get rid of this problem and eliminate potential
threats from Zorven."
"Always the cautious, heh Bohr? I don't think she represents any threat now or
never, But if it means so much to you, I will do it in the name of our
brotherhood."
"Very good, Vendran. I knew i could count on you."
"Anything else, brother?"
"Not now."
"Then, go with the Light."
"Go with the Light, Vendran."
And vendran raises his hand in a hailing gesture, and the image shimmers and
fades away.

ExtraDesc orange~
As you place your attention upon the orange crystal, it glows with an orange
light and at the same momento the image on the mirror twists and changes into
something completely different. On the other side, you see a decrepit looking
woman, with pointed ears, a greasy, dirty white hair, and the face half
decomposed. It is surely an undead of some sort. Though she is hunchbacked and
wears old, dirty rags, you see in her face a look of demonic authority that
seems to look into you like a glass.

At this, a soft, female voice says:
"Last recorded message from third of Derranti, four thousand, five hundred and
fifty four. Message from Herkanna Malicia, coming through four linear plane-
gates."
You hear a voice from the mirror say:
"What do you want, Herkanna?"
And the horrid, decrepit wonam replies with an ironic look on her face:
"Always straight to the point, heh Bohr? Is that way to treat your old ally?"
"State your business, Herkanna."
"Very well, then. I was thinking about the next month's sacrifice..."
"Yes, I already have the children on my dungeon, why?"
"No, no, no. I was thinking of something different this time..."
"Our arrengement did not specified that."
"Blast it! I'm saying the rules changed, Bohr. For next month's sacrifice I
want Kephlen's children, and his wife."
"What? What use are they to you? why them?"
"It's none of your concern, old Magi."
"And why do you want them now?"
"Well... who knows if you will be alive next month... I may never get another
chance like this."
Herkanna then seems to look intensely at Bohr for a moment, expecting the
answer she has already foreseen. At last, he speaks:
"Very well. You'll have them. I have grown tired of that man, anyway."
"I knew we could come to terms... old Magi..."
And as she says "old Magi" with a superior irony, and turns away, the image on
the mirror shimmers again and fades away...
~
ExtraDesc yellow~
As you place your attention over this yellow crystal, the image on the mirror
shimmers and changes, revealing another room, and a tall man, with short, dark
hair and big, blue eyes fixed on a penetrating, studying and at the same time
superior position. He wears a grey robe filled with ornaments with a big crest
of the Magi in it.

At this, you hear a soft, female voice saying:
"Last recorded message from twelve of Ithanar, four thousand, five hundred and
fifty four. Message from Cromnus of Elysium."
The tall man looks at someone behind the mirror and says:
"Hail, Bohr!"
And Bohr, behind the mirror, answers:
"Hail, Cromnus. How are things?"
"No time for chit-chat anymore, Bohr. How are you standing for tomorrow?"
"All set, Cromnus. I have my spells ready and my items have been carefully
enchanted."
"Very well, Is the jewel of destruction ready?"
"One week ago. Is the dark mandala set up?"
"With our jewel, all i need is Nigros' confirmation with the crown of Death."
"Good. Any news from our spies above?"
"It seems most of them were found out and done for, but the last reports I had
were quite confident. The Gods, as we expected, are also readying themselves
for battle at this very moment, but it seems they will bring us no surprises
at all."
"Good. We will meet at..."
"The appointed time are the starfields, at noon, tomorrow. We will meet at the
Dolmen of Strenght."
"I thought we would go for a protection pattern, instead."
"Don't start it again. We have been through this for almost six months now.
Relax, Bohr. Be ready that everything will go on as foreseen."
"Very well, then, Brother. Until tomorrow."
"Until tomorrow, borther Bohr."
Cromnus raises his hand in a hailing gesture, and the immage shimmers and
fades away.

ExtraDesc blue~
As you place your attention on the blue cristal, the mirror comes alive and
it's image fades, revealing the image of a strange man, with a red-metalic
skin, hair that seems to be made by silver, and eyes of gold. He is wearing
a noble blue clothe, and, though strange, has a very thoughtful demeanor in
him.

You hear a soft female's voice saying:
"Last recorded message from sixth of derranti, four thousand, five hundred and
fourty three, fourteen hours. Message from Demos of Gandallior."

The metalic man looks through the mirror and you hear someone's voice from
behind it:
"Hail, Demos."
And the metalic man answers:
"Hail, Bohr. How are things?"
And Bohr answers:
"Fine enough. How were things in the Dragon realms?"
And Demos replies:
"Good. The Dragons will stand neutral in the battle. Only those who serve a
God will strike, but we got the approval from the Demons of the third nether-
world that they will contain their attack as best as they can. How were things
with that Zorven fellow? Is he for real?"
"You won't believe it, my friend. He is Indeed a fallen God, and he has
already given us the last harmonic base for the Uncreation Spell. He even made
a small demonstration for us. It really seems that he knows what he is talking
about."
"I see... but how about his allegiance?"
"Excuse me?"
"You sure knows he might be willing for us to kill the Gods so he can go back
to his place."
"Indeed, but there will be no need for that. We have set things up so that the
Gods will find out of his betrayal and will lock him up in some dimension.
However, with the knowledge he has already provided us, we will be able to
communicate with him in this prison of his and fake a spell to try to release
him. This way we will have him restrained by a power greater than his, and
will also keep up with the communications."
"You have considered in this plan that the Gods may create a spell to block us
as well, don't you?"
"Oh, yes. If that is the case, with what we already have, we can finish the
Uncreation spell, at best. For us, right now, Zorven's imprisonment is the top
priority. Either way, we win."
Demos gives out a faint smile and says:
"Very well, I will return to my duties, then. I have pressing business in the
elemental plane. Good fortune."
"Same to you, brother."
Demos raises his hand in a hailing gesture, and the image shimmers and fades.

ExtraDesc white~
As you place your attention upon the white crystal, it pulsated with a white
light and the mirror suddenly went alive. You then see the image of a tall,
pale-faced, thin but bright man standing on the other side, looking concerned.
At this time, a soft, female voice says:
"Last recorded message from fifth of ithanar, four thousand, five hundred
and fourty three, eight hours. Message from Graviel of Sotheria."

And the person speaks:
"Master Bohr. Thank you for attending my call."
And you hear another, masculine voice, coming from your side of the mirror:
"State your business, Graviel of Sotheria."
And the man answers:
"I wish to understand, master, the reasons for your decision."
"You mean the war against the Gods, certanly."
"Yes, master, i do."
"It is the natural law, adept. Once a specific group of people rise in power,
those who are already in command tend to view them with suspicious, as a 
threat. They will, eventually, come to us. All we are doing is moving ahead of
them, in an attempt to avoid the horrible bloodshed that would come to pass if
they were ever to come here. We are destined to be the new Gods."
"But, master, with all due respect..." Replied the man,"You seem to be going
against everything you stood for in the past."
"Perhaps, Graviel, you haven't quite understood what we sttod for, then."
And the man lowers his eyes and says:
"But this war may mean the end of all."
"It will mean a new beggining."
"We don't have to go through this..."
"If we don't, the Gods will come to us."
"Have they sent you a message?"
"No."
"So how can you tell? How can you tell that what you are doing isn't simply
viewing the Gods with the elements over wich you view yourselves? Do you think
that the Gods, made of divine essence, are still subjected to such a thing as
fear and selfishness?"
"You are telling me we do not know what we are doing, Graviel of Sotheria?
That we are making a mistake? That we, the Inner circle of Magi, are being
selfish?"
And the man pauses to answer, but at last states:
"Yes, master, I am." And faces the man behing the mirror with a condifent look
on his eyes.
And the man behing the mirror answers:
"Then Graviel, for this insolence, I condemn you to one week of penance in the
library, studying our philosophy books, without any powers."
And the man simply stated:
"Yes, master, be that as you will."

And the image shimmers and fades away.

Name The Central Hall~
Desc You enter what appears to be the central hall of Castle Darkhate. Here is a
huge stairway running up, that, though half-crumbled, seems still strong
enough to hold you. There is a great double door south of here, an archway
north and a door east. There are some paintings along the wall, though none
seems to be in appreciable condition.

ExtraDesc painting~
Almost all of these paintings are unrecognizable, but there is one in parti-
cular that is not only conserved, but in perfect condition. It is a painting
of a family, a tall man with dark long hair, very strong built, wearing a
noble's vests, a tall, blonde woman of incomparable beauty, with soft skin and
blue eyes, and a carefree expression that, even from this painting, cativates
most, and a young couple of kids, a boy and a girl, who seems to have been
ordenated to get serious for this picture, since theis faces and expressions
are those of the most wicked and trouble-making children. They all seem,
though, quite at ease with each other, and the feeling og peace in everyone's
face is undistinguishable.
Below the painting you see a golden plaque written:
`r"Kephlen, High general of the forces of Bohr, the magi, and his family."`c

Desc You enter a chamber filled with crystals on the wall, and a crystal coffin 
on the center, suspended by an unseen force.  All of this place's wicked and 
twisted aura are now oblivious here, as you sense a kind of peace emanating 
from this place.  The cries and yells of the tortured, in this room, seems 
to turn into a delicated music that ressonates with all the crystals.  It is 
indeed a place out of purpose here, as it seems to be an island of hope 
among the horror and despair of this world.
